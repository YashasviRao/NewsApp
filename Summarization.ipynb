            "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-12/221207-meghan-markle-prince-harry-ew-256p-6b7279.jpg\n",
            "\n",
            "LONDON — The epic squabble between Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, and the rest of the British royal family burst back into the open Thursday, in a Netflix series that promised to reveal the “truth” about the rift pitting Hollywood glamor against the centuries-old institution.\n",
            "Harry and Meghan are clearly keen to tell the story of their relationship from their perspective. But while the the first three of the six episodes do feature some unseen footage of the couple and messages between them, they offer little new information about them and the controversies that have swirled around them.\n",
            "“This is a great love story,” Harry says in the first 10 minutes. “And the crazy thing is, I think this love story is only getting started.”\n",
            "Referring to his mother, Princess Diana, who was 36 when she died in a car crash while being chased by photographers in Paris, Harry describes himself as “my mother’s son” when talking about his relationship with Meghan.\n",
            "“I think for so many people in the family, especially obviously the men, there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold, as opposed to someone you are perhaps destined to be with. The difference between making decisions between your head or your heart,” he says.\n",
            "“My mom certainly made most of her decisions, if not all of them, from her heart and I am my mother’s son,” he adds. \n",
            "The series is being carefully watched in Britain, with coverage of the documentary dominating publications that Harry has accused of hounding his family.\n",
            "“Sussexes’ war on royals” intones the Daily Mail. “Netfibs: Five times Meg and Harry appeared to change their story in bombshell Netflix doc,” The Sun proclaims.\n",
            "Aside from showing the story of their courtship, the six episodes of “Harry & Meghan” also look set to highlight long-running grievances that have roiled Britain's royal family for years.\n",
            "Harry's obvious anger at the media surfaces multiple times. He says it is his “duty to uncover this exploitation and bribery that happens within our media,” and is “genuinely concerned” for the safety of his family. “No one know the full truth, we know the full truth, the institution knows the full truth and the media knows the full truth because they’ve been in on it.” \n",
            "“Every relationship that I had within a matter of weeks or months was splattered all over the newspapers and that person’s family harassed and their lives turned upside down,” he says later.\n",
            "After their relationship became public, Meghan says in the second episode, members of the media “paid certain neighbors” near her home in Toronto “to put a livestream camera into my backyard.”\n",
            "“My face was everywhere, my life was everywhere, tabloids had taken over everything,” she adds.\n",
            "The episode also touches on Meghan’s early life and features her mom, Doria Ragland, who describes the last five years as “challenging.”   \n",
            "Meghan, who has described herself as mixed race, also talks about the media’s coverage of her race. “It’s very different to be a minority but not be treated as a minority right off the bat. Obviously now people are very aware of my race because they made it such an issue when I went to the U.K. But before that, most people didn’t treat me like a Black woman,” she says.    \n",
            "The third episode serves as a sort of lesson on racism and oppression stemming from Britain's vast empire, and the historical relationship between slavery and the royal family. \n",
            "The British tabloids have intensely scrutinized Meghan, publishing stories about her estranged family following her engagement and marriage to Harry in May 2018. The couple has won several lawsuits against their publishers in recent years, while some remain unresolved.\n",
            "Harry says that the media coverage early in their relationship was viewed by a lot of his family “almost like a rite of passage.”\n",
            "“Some of the members of the family were like, ‘Right, my wife has been put through that, so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be different?’ And I said, ‘The difference here is the race element.’”\n",
            "Later he adds, \"The fact that I was dating an American actress was probably what clouded their judgment more than anything else at the beginning. Oh, he’s dating an actress, this won’t last.\"  \n",
            "It is awkward timing for the release of the show, coming three months after Queen Elizabeth II’s death and the ascension of Harry’s father, Charles, as king. It also comes less than a week after his brother, Prince William, and his wife, Catherine, Princess of Wales, made a high-profile trip to the United States. \n",
            "Before and after leaving Britain for North America, the couple accused the royal household of not defending Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, from the intrusive and sometimes racist coverage by the country’s voracious tabloid press. In addition, Harry is challenging in court a decision by the British government to deny him police protection while in Britain. \n",
            "Directed by Liz Garbus — the Emmy-winning producer of the Netflix documentary “What Happened, Miss Simone?” — the three episodes are being released Thursday and three more Dec. 15. The Sussexes' media company, Archewell Productions, is listed as one of the three producers.\n",
            "Interest in the couple intensified after they stepped down as senior royals in January 2020 to eventually build new lives in California. Harry was later stripped of his honorary military titles and the British Home Office — the ministry responsible for policing, immigration and security — decided that he would no longer receive personal police security while in Britain even if he were to cover the cost himself.\n",
            "In a wide-ranging interview with the media mogul Oprah Winfrey last March, the couple described a lack of support for the newlyweds and Meghan's experience with suicidal thoughts. The pair also alleged that in the months leading up to the birth of their son, Archie, a royal insider expressed “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born.”\n",
            "“That conversation, I’m never going to share. But at the time, it was awkward. I was a bit shocked,” Harry told the talk show host. Winfrey later said the conversation was not with the queen or her husband, Prince Philip. \n",
            "Even before going live, the series elicited a strong response in Britain, where the “feeling amongst the British public is 'enough is enough,'” the author and journalist Katie Nicholl told NBC News on Wednesday. \n",
            "“We have heard this before. What more can they say?” she added.\n",
            "Nicholl said that Charles was attempting to put “down his blueprint,” but “there seems to be so many distractions, particularly from across the Atlantic and coming out of the Sussex camp.” \n",
            "“It seems to be a case of anything you can do, we’re going to do and get more headlines,” she added.\n",
            "However, Nicholl said, Buckingham Palace would take allegations about leaking and planting stories “very, very seriously,” because it was “potentially quite damaging.” \n",
            "“This is a centuries-old institution that wants to prove that it’s fit for modern purpose,” she said, adding that the couple’s racism accusations were “damaging” to both the palace and to “Britain as a country.”  \n",
            "Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on the series.\n",
            "The trailers for the series have already courted controversy as several seasoned royal commentators have suggested that archival footage and pictures featured in them were taken at events that had nothing to do with the couple. \n",
            "One clip showing men running with cameras was used to illustrate the paparazzi hounding the couple, but was taken as the British model and reality TV star Katie Price arrived at a courthouse to be sentenced for DUI, analysis by several British media outlets including Sky News has shown. (Sky News is owned by Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)   \n",
            "Doug Seeburg also told The Sun newspaper that the image featuring him among a throng of other photographers was taken ahead of the premiere for “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two,” in July 2011, years before the couple met.  \n",
            "“In the Netflix trailer, it’s implied the photographers, including me, were trying to get a shot of the royal couple — but that’s nonsense,” he told the tabloid.\n",
            "Netflix did not respond to a request for comment on the record.  \n",

            "CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico — On Wednesday morning, as many as a thousand people waited in freezing temperatures on the south side of a metal fence for border agents to open the gate to the United States.\n",
            "Customs and Border Protection agents let 10 or 15 through the fence every few minutes, but the line of migrants still stretched for hundreds of yards. The migrants have built fires to keep warm and share cheap blankets, and whenever a few make it through the fence they pass their blankets back for others to use.\n",
            "Two cities on opposite sides of the border — El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico — are bracing for what could be a historic level of migration later this month when the Covid ban known as Title 42 is finally lifted. But many migrants aren’t waiting for the ban to end, and another surge has already begun.\n",
            "El Paso city leaders say the influx they’re seeing in their city has led to hundreds of migrants sleeping on the streets, at bus stations and inside the local airport.\n",
            "CBP agents are reporting approximately 2,500 migrants crossing into El Paso per day, a number expected to rise when, absent a court-ordered stay, Title 42 ends Dec. 21. Since the Trump administration imposed Title 42 in March 2020, migrants attempting to enter the U.S. to claim asylum have been sent back to Mexico more than 2.4 million times. After the ban lifts, more of them will be allowed in to pursue asylum claims.\n",
            "In Juarez, shelters are filling quickly as more migrants are arriving before Title 42 is lifted.\n",
            "Jose Lujan and his wife, Jocelyn Quevedo, left Guatemala in late September with their 8-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter, and are waiting in Juarez for Title 42 to end before trying to enter the U.S.\n",
            "“We heard Title 42 may go away next week, so we are going to wait until then,” Lujan said.\n",
            "Quevedo said organized crime groups threatened to dismember her family in Guatemala, so they felt they had no choice but to leave. \n",
            "Deputy City Manager Mario D’Agostino told reporters at a press conference that the current influx is “quite a large increase from what we’ve seen.”\n",
            "“That number continues to climb as we’re approaching the Dec. 21 deadline,” he said. “It adds great concern to the city of El Paso, the community at large.”\n",
            "Typically, migrants are taken to local shelters from where they can arrange for transportation into the interior of the U.S., where they will live while awaiting court hearings. But as the population of newly arrived migrants has spiked, shelters have been over capacity and Border Patrol agents in El Paso have released migrants directly from their custody.\n",
            "On Monday, a “few hundred” migrants were released from CBP custody onto the streets of the city, which followed a release of more than 500 Saturday.\n",
            "The city is asking the Biden administration to be paid back for caring for the migrants, a responsibility that usually falls on the federal government.\n",
            "Robert Cortinas, El Paso’s chief financial officer, said the city is waiting on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reimburse it for $3.5 million spent to temporarily shelter and care for migrants. \n",
            "On the other side of the border in Juarez, migrants continue to gather in the December cold. Javier Carrillo, a priest at the Casa del Migrante shelter, said he is bracing for still more to arrive when the ban ends and hopes he can house all who need it.\n",
            "In a statement Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security said it was deploying more agents to the region to deal with the influx, which it blamed on criminal smuggling organizations exploiting migrants for profit.\n",
            "“Criminal smuggling organizations are behind this, exploiting vulnerable migrants for enormous profit,” DHS said. “The border remains closed, and individuals attempting to enter unlawfully are being expelled as required by court order under the Title 42 public health authority. The Department of Homeland Security continues to quickly decompress the El Paso area, and safely and efficiently screen and process migrants to place them in immigration enforcement proceedings consistent with our laws.\n",

            "Musk tweeted that the accounts violated Twitter's \"doxxing\" rules, meaning they revealed nonpublic personal information.\n",
            "The account, @ElonJet, which had amassed more than half a million followers, was listed Wednesday morning as suspended for having violated unspecified Twitter rules. Later in the day, Twitter accounts tracking the jets of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos were also suspended.\n",
            "The Musk-tracking account was created by Jack Sweeney, 20, a Florida college student. Sweeney's personal Twitter account was also suspended Wednesday.\n",
            "Musk went further Wednesday evening when he said he would pursue legal action against Sweeney after he claimed a “stalker” confronted a car carrying Musk’s child Tuesday night in Los Angeles. Musk did not say whether police were called.\n",
            "Spokespeople for the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department were unable to confirm that any report was made without more information.\n",
            "“Last night, car carrying lil X in LA was followed by crazy stalker (thinking it was me), who later blocked car from moving & climbed onto hood,” Musk wrote. “Legal action is being taken against Sweeney & organizations who supported harm to my family.”\n",
            "Sweeney said he hasn't received any notification of legal action, and the last time his bot tweeted anything was Dec. 12, \"which is not last night, so I don’t get how that’s connected.”\n",
            "\"They have their legal standing, and all I’m doing is taking their data and putting it on Twitter,\" he said in a phone interview. “There’s nothing I’m doing wrong, and I didn’t mean any harm.”\n",

            "Twitter also updated its rules to make linking out to “travel routes, actual physical location, or other identifying information that would reveal a person’s location” a violation of its “private information and media policy.”\n",
            "The @ElonJet account was briefly reinstated Wednesday evening after attention was called to the suspension — but by Wednesday night it appeared to have been suspended again. Other social media accounts created by Sweeney tracking Musk's jet, including ones on Instagram and Telegram, remained active.\n",
            "The Twitter Safety account addressed changes to policy Wednesday evening, noting that it decided to ban posts on other people's live locations because of \"increased risk of physical harm.\"\n",
            "\"You can still share your own live location on Twitter. Tweets that share someone else’s historical (not same-day) location information are also not prohibited by this policy,\" Twitter said.\n",

            "Sweeney has told CNBC he started the Twitter account in June 2020 because he was a fan of Musk’s work at his Tesla and SpaceX companies. \n",
            "“Even now, my dream car is definitely a Tesla,” Sweeney said.\n",
            "He also told CNBC that Musk previously offered to pay him $5,000 to take down the account because it was a safety risk.\n",

            "The iconic image of the 2022 World Cup may well be Morocco’s Sofiane Boufal dancing with his mum after his team’s brilliant upset victory over Portugal in the quarterfinals. It was a statement of pride and of priorities, a reminder that, as the mother of the great Zinedine Zidane is reputed to have once said, “Some things are bigger than football.” It was also a moment of unbridled joy, as the Atlas Lions beat another of Morocco’s former colonizers — and cued up a symbolic reckoning with the last of its colonial overlords, France. The geopolitical implications of Wednesday’s semifinal are almost too on the nose.\n",
            "The first World Cup tournament staged in the Arab world has captured, in symbolic form, an emerging multipolar reality in which the post-1945 hegemony of Western powers has receded in the face of challenges from multiple quarters: Morocco has reached the semifinals, and Saudi Arabia humiliated one of the tournament favorites, Argentina, in the group stage, while Tunisia did the same to its former colonizer, France. Japan beat heavyweights Germany and Spain. The traditional power (im)balance in global soccer — as in geopolitics — can no longer be taken for granted.\n",
            "Boufal and his mother — like the majority of Morocco’s players and coaches — live in European cities, part of that continent’s vast marginalized and embattled migrant underclass. She wore hijab, something she would be barred from doing were she a teacher or a public servant in France.\n",
            "In fact, as many as 5 million Moroccans live abroad, mostly in Europe. And they celebrated the team’s victories in raucous street celebrations in the cities of France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and beyond. For them — and for so many other migrants from the Arab world or Africa, driven by decades of desperation in their home countries to risk everything to reach Europe, only to suffer abuse and contempt — it was an electrifying milestone.\n",
            "As fullback Achraf Hakimi reportedly said after he converted the winning penalty against his native Spain: “My mother cleaned the houses, and my father was a street vendor. We come from a modest family that struggled to earn a living. Today I fight every day for them. They sacrificed themselves for me.”\n",
            "Similarly revealing has been the show of Palestinian pride in Qatar. There was no Palestinian team at the World Cup, and yet the Palestinian flag was everywhere — not only in the hands of celebrating Moroccan players and fans, but also at every game and on the streets of Doha. These displays shocked some Israeli journalists, who had been assured by their own government that its U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords with Morocco and other Arab states signaled that the Arab world had relinquished any pretense of advocacy for Palestinian rights.\n",
            "But soccer creates its own form of civil society, and in a region where civil society has been largely suppressed by authoritarians, what this World Cup has made clear is that the Arab publics are not willing to follow their unelected leaders in accepting the humiliation of accepting what leading human rights organizations have called Israel’s apartheid system.\n",
            "By waving that Palestinian flag, Moroccan fans and players expressed a very public dissent from the choices of their government and of Western powers and other Arab autocrats to abandon the Palestinians to their fate. And by continuing to advance, Morocco has kept sustained attention on these issues, even as its players prove they more than deserve to be playing on this prestigious stage.\n",
            "Morocco’s prowess as the first African team to make the semifinals of the World Cup brings us ever closer to fulfilling soccer icon Pelé’s prophecy that an African team would win the World Cup, albeit two decades later than the Brazilian legend had expected.\n",
            "Morocco’s prowess as the first African team to make the semifinals of the World Cup brings us ever closer to fulfilling soccer icon Pelé’s prophecy.\n",
            "And that prophecy would most likely not be fulfilled without soccer’s globalization. The world’s top players have for decades all played in Europe’s elite leagues, and the “technology” of the game (tactics, coaching and organization) have reached every part of the globe.\n",
            "Indeed, this was the first World Cup in which all five African teams were coached by African coaches, rather than by European journeymen. On that score, Morocco’s coach, Walid Regragui, appears to have made an exceptional difference.\n",
            "Morocco counterattacks with elegance. The team's strategy suggests its coach has rewritten the playbook that long recommended African teams play pessimistic defensive football, hoping for a lucky break. True, Morocco’s stingy defense has been a feature of its progress, but the team’s defensive record has been achieved by retaining possession and one-touch passing its way out of trouble at the back with a confidence that contrasts with the instinct to simply play long clearances. Passing has set up lightning transitions on the counterattack, in which one-touch flicks and dribbling runs create scoring opportunities. Skills, then, but also smiles: These Atlas Lions actually seem to be enjoying themselves. And Regragui is showing his peers across Africa and Europe the magic that can be achieved by releasing the tactical handbrake.\n",
            "It’s not all feel-good underdogs and gracious victors, of course. Many of the knockout-stage games of this tournament have been fraught and fractious displays of ugly football and even uglier petulance. But don’t expect more of that when Morocco faces France. Whatever the final score, I predict we’ll see heartwarming expressions of fraternity and mutual respect among the players of both sides. After all, so many of France’s stars, like Morocco’s, are the children of African migrants who’ve grown up in Europe’s ghettos. Whatever “national” shirts they wear, it’s not hard for them to see themselves, and their own mothers, in one another.\n",

            "\n",
            "Joe Biden beat Donald Trump once, and Democrats are crafting a strategy to try to beat him again in 2024 — even if his name isn’t on the ballot. \n",
            "Anticipating that Trump may fade, Biden allies hope to persuade voters that the choice is the same and that any Republican successor would have to embrace enough of his policies to be a virtual clone of Trump himself. \n",
            "Key to that approach is spotlighting Trump’s policies and worldview and forcing other GOP candidates to take positions on whether they agree with Trump or not. One statement that stands out, as Democrats see it, is Trump’s recent suggestion that parts of the Constitution could be set aside to invalidate the 2020 election results. If Democrats can show that Trump’s successors won’t condemn such remarks, they can make the case that Trumpism is on the ballot even if the man himself is sidelined, party strategists and Biden allies said.\n",
            "“As it develops, let’s say it’s Ron DeSantis and not Trump” as the Republican nominee, said Alan Kessler, a longtime Philadelphia fundraiser, referring the governor of Florida. “I don’t think it’s a heavy lift to make DeSantis into Trump.”\n",
            "An unusual dynamic is driving the Democrats’ thinking about the ’24 race. As Trump’s poll numbers sag, party strategists are starting to imagine Trump’s losing the nomination fight to a younger candidate without the same mountain of baggage. Were that to happen, Biden would be stripped of perhaps the central rationale of his candidacy: While he’s an aging candidate with lackluster approval ratings, he comes off as a calmer and steadier hand than Trump. \n",
            "If Democrats succeed in painting the new GOP nominee as a Trump wannabe, however, they might be able to neutralize the advantage that a younger, fresher-faced opponent might bring to a race against Biden, who is 80.\n",
            "Biden’s allies think voters will be swayed by comments like Trump’s statement Dec. 3 that the level of “fraud” in the 2020 election was so severe that it “allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.” (A slew of court rulings and audits haven’t shown any election fraud on a scale that would overturn Biden’s victory.)\n",
            "Many statements from Trump spark outrage and then disappear from view, eclipsed by something else he says that’s even more incendiary. But Democrats interviewed about the emerging 2024 strategy said they plan to make sure this particular comment isn’t soon forgotten. They expect ad campaigns built around Trump’s suggestion that the Constitution — the founding document that enshrines America’s democracy — can be set aside. (Trump issued another statement on his Truth Social platform insisting he hadn’t said he wanted to “terminate” the Constitution.)\n",
            "“It’s the goal of Democrats and independent groups and, eventually, campaigns to not let this go unremarked,” said Democratic activist David Brock, the president of Facts First USA, a group countering Republican-led congressional investigations.\n",
            "“I really feel — and many people I’ve spoken to feel — that [Trump’s remark] definitely crossed a line and is definitely grist for Democratic campaign ads and messaging.”\n",
            "The Democratic National Committee plans to hire staffers in New Hampshire, South Carolina and other key states targeting Republican presidential primaries. Part of their mission will be to try to get Republican candidates to take positions on Trump’s statements, including his views about the Constitution, said a national Democratic strategist familiar with the planning. The DNC communication staffers will be in place earlier than in past presidential campaign cycles, the strategist said.\n",
            "“You’ll see a pretty aggressive and concerted effort to have Republicans answer for what he says,” the strategist said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk more freely. “Donald Trump’s shadow will be over the party for as long as he’s alive.”\n",
            "Republicans bet such tactics won’t matter.\n",
            "A Trump ally, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, said he doesn’t believe Trump will suffer a backlash over his comment about the Constitution.\n",
            "“I doubt if this will play any role in 2024,” Gingrich said in an interview. “Trump has already denied any desire to suspend the Constitution.”\n",
            "Some Democratic strategists are skeptical that anyone who emerges as the GOP front-runner can be sold to voters as Trump’s ideological twin. Trump’s persona and record as a twice-impeached ex-president are too unusual to make the claim convincing, they argue. Larry Hogan, Maryland’s moderate Republican governor, who has been mentioned as a presidential candidate, has denounced Trump repeatedly. Democrats tried repeatedly to tie Glenn Youngkin to Trump in the 2021 Virginia governor’s race — and failed. \n",
            "“Trump’s call to terminate the Constitution was extreme and beyond the pale — something we’ve never heard from a modern-day former president who also happens to be running again,” said Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist. “I don’t know that you can credibly tie Trump’s call to terminate the Constitution to every single Republican candidate or even to the MAGA movement as a whole.” \n",
            "So far, a few prominent Republicans and possible presidential candidates have trodden carefully around Trump’s comment. Outright condemnation risks alienating Trump’s rank-and-file voters. Former Vice President Mike Pence gave an anodyne response that it’s important for public officials to “make it clear that they will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.”\n",
            "Asked during an appearance in South Carolina whether Trump’s comment was dangerous, Pence hedged, saying, “That will be a decision for the American people in the days ahead.”\n",
            "Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told reporters last week that anyone who supported the idea of not following the Constitution “would have a very hard time being sworn in” as president. Yet McConnell wouldn’t say whether he would refuse to back Trump should he win the Republican nomination.\n",
            "Whatever the political dividends, some advisers insist that combating threats to democracy is, for Biden, a moral imperative. He has delivered major speeches describing what he sees as mortal threats to the nation’s tradition of self-government.\n",
            "“Trump is a threat,” said John Anzalone, a Biden pollster. “The fact is he has a demagogic pull on people. He made people believe in the election lie, and he can make people believe it’s OK to throw out the Constitution.”\n",
            "Advisers say a recurring theme of Biden’s private conversations with historians who’ve studied the rise of authoritarian movements is that such threats can’t be “wished away” but must be consistently and aggressively called out.\n",
            "Trump’s comment “is very serious,” said longtime Biden confidant Ted Kaufman, a former U.S. senator from Delaware. “For any other elected official I’ve known, especially a president, it would be disqualifying. If George W. Bush or Bill Clinton or anyone else suggested we put aside the Constitution, it would be disqualifying politically, let alone the fact that you swear an oath to uphold the Constitution when you’re sworn in.”\n",
            "Constitutional experts are largely baffled by what Trump might have had in mind about a statement that is still visible on his social media site.\n",
            "One said the idea Trump floated echoes constitutions in certain South American countries, which have emergency suspension clauses. Nothing like that exists in the U.S. Constitution.\n",
            "“It has nothing to do with anything constitutional,” said Robert Post, a professor at Yale Law School. “It has to do with the ending of constitutional government.”\n",

            "Twenty-nine members of the U.N. Economic and Social Council voted in favor of a resolution put forward by the U.S. for the immediate termination of Iran from the commission for the remainder of its 2022-26 term. Eight members voted against the resolution, and 16 abstained.\n",
            "The resolution, which the U.S. proposed last month, expressed “serious concern” over Iran's actions since September “to continuously undermine and increasingly suppress the human rights of women and girls, including the right to freedom of expression and opinion, often with the use of excessive force,” in contradiction of the commission’s mandate, “as well as through the use of lethal force resulting in the deaths of peaceful protestors, including women and girls.” \n",
            "Prior to the vote, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Iran's membership put an “ugly stain” on the commission’s credibility.\n",
            "“The commission is the premier U.N. body for promoting gender equality and empowering women,” she said. “It cannot do its important work if it’s being undermined from within.\"\n",
            "“We can act in this moment to support women. We can act in direct response to our constituents, the global community of women,\" she said, adding that Iran's government wanted to \"wiggle\" out of the vote, \"to use misinformation and procedural tricks to obscure the truth and avoid kind of accountability.\"\n",

            "Iran's state-run Nour News media outlet, which is associated with the Iranian National Security Council, swiftly rebuked the country's expulsion on Twitter, calling the move \"a clear violation of the philosophy of the #UN and its charter, and worse, the Secretary General of the UN, as the guardian of the credibility of this institution, has remained silent.”\n",
            "Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died in September, a few days after being taken into custody by morality police in Tehran for allegedly failing to fully cover her hair and defying the country’s strict dress codes. Her death sparked outrage across the country and more than two months of protests. \n",
            "In the wake of her death, Iranian activists abroad and human rights groups called on the Biden administration to rally other countries to remove Iran from the U.N. commission over its response to the protests, which have been led by Iranian women.\n",
            "Iran, which ranks 143rd among 146 countries in the World Economic Forum's global gender gap index, was voted onto the commission by secret ballot.

            "A former Twitter employee found guilty of spying on users on behalf of the Saudi royal family has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison. \n",
            "Ahmad Abouammo, a dual U.S.-Lebanese citizen who helped oversee media partnerships for Twitter in the Middle East and North Africa, was part of a scheme to acquire the personal information of users, including phone numbers and birth dates, for a Saudi government agent. He was sentenced Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n",
            "The Justice Department has said it believes that another former Twitter employee accused of accessing user accounts and a man accused of helping the Saudi government with the scheme have fled to Saudi Arabia to evade American authorities.\n",
            "The Saudi government severely penalizes anti-government expression on social media sites like Twitter. In April, courts sentenced Salma al-Shehab, a Saudi citizen and 34-year-old mother of two children, to 34 years in prison for tweets protesting the government.\n",
            "According to testimony from an FBI agent presented to the Northern District of California, a Saudi government agent began courting Abouammo in 2014 by buying him gifts and depositing money in his cousin’s bank account. Abouammo then began secretly accessing accounts of users who were critical of the Saudi government and sharing their email addresses and phone numbers with the government agent.\n",
            "The Saudi consulate did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
            "Even after Abouammo left Twitter in May 2015, he still helped the Saudi government by contacting former co-workers and encouraging them to verify particular Saudi accounts or remove posts that the Saudi agent highlighted as violating the site’s terms of service, the FBI agent said in their testimony. He received hundreds of thousands of dollars and used some of that money to put a down payment on a home in Seattle, Wash.\n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and members of his Federal Reserve Board might not be cruel and heartless people, but they are in the process of killing the American dream of home ownership for millions of families. As the central bank continues to aggressively raise interest rates in its battle to get inflation under control, the housing market is collateral damage. Sadly, it didn’t have to be this way.\n",
            "After the Fed raised its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the seventh time this year, it’s likely the dynamic will only get worse. For every percentage point increase in mortgage rates, the number of households who can afford a $400,000 mortgage declines by 3 to 4 million, according to Freddie Mac, the federally sponsored enterprise that promotes home lending. Freddie Mac estimates that 15 million potential homebuyers have been priced out of the housing market this year because, for the first time in U.S. history, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate has more than doubled in a year’s time, from about 3% to more than 6%.\n",
            "Had the Federal Reserve been more vigilant on its inflation watch, much of this pain could have been avoided.\n",
            "As mortgage rates are rising faster — much faster — than home prices will drop, Americans who do still buy new homes will be digging deeper into their wallets, adding to the financial stress of high inflation. And more financial pressure may be in the pipeline for the growing number of buyers who are now opting for adjustable rate mortgages. Such mortgages make their payments lower in the short term, but they can easily adjust upward, often by 2% or more, several years down the road, making monthly installments intolerably expensive. \n",
            "These financial pressures are coming after the Covid-19 relief program’s federal moratorium on foreclosures ended in July 2021. Since then, foreclosure filings have been ballooning, up 57% in November compared to the same month last year. Though for now, they are nowhere near levels hit during the housing crash of 2008.\n",
            "Already the housing market, which accounts for nearly 18% of the U.S. economy, is in a serious recession, with home sales sinking and prices beginning to fall. With inflation now running at an annual rate of 7.1%, as measured by November’s Consumer Price Index, the Fed is trying to slow it through a process that economists call “demand destruction.” By raising interest rates, the central bank makes it more expensive to borrow and spend. As the most interest-sensitive sector of the economy, housing gets slammed. \n",
            "It’s not just prospective homebuyers who are suffering the consequences of sharply higher mortgage rates. Homeowners are finding they can’t sell their homes for what they were worth just a few months ago. This is particularly troublesome for couples approaching retirement, such as neighbors of mine who are looking to downsize. \n",
            "Three months ago, a home very comparable to theirs sold in our neighborhood for the impressive price of more than $1.3 million. But the couple recognize they are now selling into a declining market, so they listed their home for just under $1 million. It’s as if a chunk of their nest egg has suddenly been snatched from underneath them.\n",
            "Sadly, had the Federal Reserve been more vigilant on its inflation watch, much of this pain could have been avoided. The Fed’s mandate is to maintain price stability while attempting to maximize employment, and among its primary tools is the Fed funds rate. It’s the cost of borrowing for banks. They, of course, pass that cost onto their customers, while also tying their mortgage rates to Treasury bond yields, which have shot up this year, reflecting rising inflation expectations.\n",
            "Wednesday’s rate increase caps the most intensive year of central bank inflation fighting since 1981, when interest rates soared to double digits in a similar campaign led by Paul Volcker, the Fed chair who slayed that bout of inflation but in the process pushed the economy into a severe double-dip recession. \n",
            "In the first half of last year, inflation was accelerating rapidly, increasing many times over. By June the Consumer Price Index was clocking in at an annual rate of 5.4%. Yet Powell argued the pickup in inflation was transitory. So, Powell and his Fed governors hung on to their new policy, introduced in 2020, that permitted inflation to run above the Fed’s traditional target of 2%. \n",
            "The Fed at the time was far more concerned with pumping up an economy battered by Covid than preventing a pickup in inflation. In fact, the central bank was injecting tens of billions of dollars into the financial system every month to grease the economy’s wheels.\n",
            "As it turned out, the central bank was helping to fuel the inflation it was supposed to be preventing. The Fed’s foot was pressing on the economic accelerator far too long as it persisted in extraordinary efforts to prevent the country from falling into a pandemic-induced recession, and it failed to hit the brakes in the summer of 2021, when inflation began to accelerate. \n",
            "A humbled Powell would later concede it was time to “retire” his description of inflation as transitory and admitted, “I think we understand better how little we understand about inflation.” Now the Fed is trying to compensate for its mistakes by raising interest rates at the fastest pace in four decades.\n",
            "As the housing market slumps, the Federal Reserve is fighting a battle not only to curb inflation, but to restore its reputation as an inflation fighter. Sadly, this is a necessary evil because our country’s economic stability requires that we keep inflation under control and that’s the Fed’s job. But if the nation’s central bankers had more foresight, it would not be so hard today for millions of people to achieve home ownership and a secure retirement.\n",

            "“On Saturday, December 10, during one of our two PNW Commencement ceremonies, I made a comment that was offensive and insensitive,” Keon wrote in a statement Wednesday. “I am truly sorry for my unplanned, off-the-cuff response to another speaker, as my words have caused confusion, pain, and anger.” \n",
            "The school, a regional public university, did not respond to a request for comment, but directed NBC News to Keon’s statement. Keon also did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

At one point in his speech, Dedelow mentions a “made-up” language he sometimes uses on-air and with family. Keon took the podium afterward and announced, “Well, all I can say is,” before launching into indistinguishable phrases. \n",

Purdue University Northwest was ranked in the top 20 Midwest regional universities for campus ethnic diversity by U.S. News & World Report for the 2022-2023 school year.\n",
            "Keon, who wrote in his statement that he “did not intend to be hurtful,” added that he would be meeting with members of the student government as well as directing new diversity initiative, PNW Respecting Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity, to understand and address issues of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.\n",
            "“I will learn from this and assure you that Purdue Northwest and I will take action to prevent such missteps from occurring in the future,” he wrote. \n",
            "Keon’s apology comes after a clip of his remarks went viral Wednesday. Richard Lee, a professor at the University of Minnesota, who posted the video to Twitter on Tuesday, said he initially saw the clip of the commencement on a former student’s Facebook page. Lee, who is also the director of his school’s Asian American studies program, told NBC News that the remarks were not only racist, but also an example of an “abuse of power.” \n",
            "“When you are the chancellor of a university, during the commencement ceremony, when students and families and faculty and staff are there to celebrate and honor the achievements, it was just really a slap in the face to so many of those students who were there just for a cheap joke,” Lee said.  \n",
            "Lee added that Keon’s description of the language he was impersonating as “Asian” shows that he essentially perceives Asian Americans as “all the same.” \n",
            "“He doesn’t even make the joke in terms of ‘Oh, I’m trying to speak in a bad Chinese accent or in a specific language,’” Lee said. “Not that it would make it better, but it just shows you the way in which he sees a very heterogeneous racial group.”\n",
            "Keon’s behavior, Lee said, is reflective of larger problems that Asian and Asian American students in academia often face. While the racial group is often reified as a “model minority” in academic circles, they are simultaneously the target of ridicule, Lee said.\n",

            "'Harry & Meghan' wrestles with lingering impact of racism and colonialism\n",
            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "LONDON — Four years ago, the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, carried the promise of a modernized monarchy. A member of the British royal family, the whitest of institutions, was marrying a mixed-race American woman.\n",
            "But in their docuseries on Netflix — the second installment of which will be released Thursday — the Sussexes, now based in the U.S., suggest that the ghosts of slavery and centuries of colonialism risk overshadowing a royal couple that had embodied hopes of reconciliation.\n",
            "The first three of the six episodes touch on Britain's history as the world's largest empire — controlling swaths of Asia, Africa and the Americas — and seek to link this legacy with the treatment of Meghan even before she married Harry, both by the media and the royals themselves.\n",
            "It highlights the intense media scrutiny Meghan and her family were subjected to when the couple’s relationship became public and headlines published in British newspapers including, “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton,” and another saying, “One’s gone GangstER.”\n",
            "Another column, by Rachel Johnson, sister of former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, referred to Meghan's “dreadlocked mother” Doria Ragland and “exotic blood.”\n",
            "Ragland, who is Black, says in the documentary that she told her daughter, “This is really about race. And she said, ‘Mommy, I don’t want to hear that.’ And I said, ‘You may not want to hear that but this is what’s coming down the pike.’”\n",
            "In the documentary, Meghan said she hadn't thought much about her race until the media made it an issue.\n",
            "“It’s very different to be a minority but not be treated as a minority right off the bat,” Meghan said in the second episode of the six-part series, the first three of which were released by the streaming service. “Obviously now people are very aware of my race because they made it such an issue when I went to the U.K.”    \n",
            "On the flip side, Harry suggested that some of his family did not recognize the role that race played in the coverage given to Meghan as compared to other members of the family.  \n",
            "“As far as a lot of the family were concerned, everything she was being put through, they had been put through as well. So it was almost like a rite of passage,” he said.\n",
            "“Some of the members of the family were like, ‘Right my wife has been put through that, so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be different?’\" Harry recalled. \"And I said, ‘The difference here is the race element.’” \n",
            "In a wide-ranging interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, the couple also alleged that in the months leading up to their son Archie’s birth, a royal insider expressed “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born.” Winfrey later said it was not Harry's grandparents, the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, who made the remarks.\n",
            "Prince William later denied that the royal family is racist.\n",
            "“We’re very much not a racist family,” William said on March 11, 2021.\n",
            "Meera Sabaratnam, an expert in international relations at London’s SOAS university, told NBC News that some of the attitudes experienced by the couple “are very old.” \n",
            "“They were attitudes of superiority to people around the world but particularly Africans and often African Americans being of lesser prestige,” she said. “I think it’s important to remember that some of these attitudes were very widespread in Britain and in some respects continue to be widespread,” she added. \n",
            "She said “the double standard was obvious” with the way that Catherine, Princess of Wales, had been treated by sections of the British media compared to Meghan, particularly during their pregnancies.\n",
            "“Meghan had this unique focus and it appeared that the level of scrutiny she was subject to went over and above everyone else in the family,” she said. \n",
            "For Marcus Ryder, a director at the Sir Lenny Henry Centre for Media Diversity at the U.K.’s Birmingham City University, the lack of diversity in British newsrooms was part of the problem. \n",
            "“British media is disproportionately white, and that shapes the way stories are framed,” he said.\n",
            "“Obviously the Meghan and Harry story is very high profile, but it plays out in the way we frame immigration stories, it decides how we cover Ukraine versus other conflicts and it influences the media generally,” he added. \n",
            "However, he said there had been moves to improve and “there are people of influence who want to make change.”    \n",
            "The documentary also focuses on what Meghan marrying into the royal family may have meant for many Black people in the U.K. In the third episode, footage shows Meghan and Harry attending a memorial service for Stephen Lawrence, a Black teenager killed in an attack by white youths in London in 1993. Two people were convicted of murder nearly 20 years later.\n",
            "“It was really significant when Meghan and Harry visited this memorial, because it represented a direct attempt to speak to the pain that many people still feel as a result of the murder of Stephen Lawrence,” writer and broadcaster Afua Hirsch says in episode three.\n",
            "Harry’s attendance of the service changed her perception of him as “racist” and “ignorant” to someone on a journey “transforming himself into an anti-racist,” she added.\n",
            "Harry goes some way in addressing his own history of racism, speaking of his “shame” after being photographed in full Nazi uniform at a costume party in 2005, at age 20.\n",
            "“It was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I felt so ashamed afterwards. All I wanted to do was make it right,” he says in the third episode.\n",
            "“I could have just ignored it and made the same mistakes over again, but I learnt from that,” he added, stating that he spoke with Britain's chief rabbi after the event and met with Holocaust survivors.\n",
            "Other incidents, such as his use of racial slurs against army colleagues of South Asian descent in a video that came to light in 2009, have so far not been covered by the documentary. Harry apologized at the time for the comments, which were made in 2006.\n",
            "The series grapples with the historical connections between the British monarchy and the slave trade — including Queen Elizabeth I's personal approval of the first commercial slave voyage in 1562 — but does not describe the British monarchy as inherently racist. Instead, Harry refers to “unconscious bias” within the royal family, which Meghan helped to educate him on.\n",
            "In 2017, Princess Michael of Kent apologized after she wore a “blackamoor” brooch to a royal Christmas lunch. Some deemed the accessory choice a slight to Meghan, who attended the event with her then-fiancé.\n",
            "That style of jewelry and sculpture, which depicts African and nonwhite male figures as servants, is widely deemed offensive by Black communities because of its associations with the slave trade and its celebration of racialized subservience.\n",
            "A spokesperson said at the time that Princess Michael, who had worn the brooch “many times before,” was “very sorry and distressed that it has caused offence.”\n",
            "Queen Elizabeth II devoted much of her reign to building and preserving the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent states, most of them former British colonies. While Hirsch describes the organization as “empire 2.0,” the documentary does not focus on campaigns in many Commonwealth states to remove the British monarchy as their heads of state, or to return looted treasures that make up part of the crown's wealth.\n",
            "The strength of feeling in some of these former colonies emerged in March when William and Kate were on a royal tour intended to strengthen Commonwealth ties and were met with protests calling for reparations and apologies for slavery in Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas.\n",
            "Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September, politicians in Australia and the Bahamas intimated that they might want to remove the U.K. monarch as head of state, following Barbados, which did so in 2021.\n",
            "“We need to grapple with our past,” Ryder said. “What we have to do is look at curriculums and how they have taken things for granted. Whether it’s school or university curriculums, which writers we’re using, what personalities we’re focusing on,” he added.\n",
            "However, he said it was “really good” that the issue of race had come to the fore with Harry and Meghan’s series, “but if the debate only ends with them, then we have a problem. We need to look at the substantive issues, not just one story.” \n",

            "\n",
            "President Joe Biden signed legislation Tuesday to codify federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages in a ceremony at the White House.\n",
            "Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff also attended.\n",
            "\"Today is a good day, a day America takes a vital step toward equality, toward liberty and justice, not just for some, but for everyone,\" Biden said.\n",
            "Biden emphasized bipartisan support for the legislation, passed by Congress last week while calling for more to be done, including a renewed push for a bill to prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation or gender identity.\n",
            "Biden also quoted directly from a 2012 interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" in which he came out in public support of same-sex marriage ahead of then-President Barack Obama. Biden's words from that interview were featured on a program for the event.\n",
            "The legislation Biden signed was drafted by a bipartisan group led by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the first openly gay person elected to the Senate. It will ensure that the federal government recognizes marriages and guarantee full benefits “regardless of the couple’s sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.” The law will not, however, require states to issue marriage licenses contrary to state laws.\n",
            "The House voted 258-169 to pass the Respect for Marriage Act last week, sending it to the president. The Senate had already passed it late last month by a vote of 61-36.\n",
            "Democrats unanimously voted to support the legislation, while most Republicans in both chambers opposed it.\n",
            "Hundreds attended the bill signing on the South Lawn, including Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., her office confirmed — an appearance with Biden that comes just days after she left the Democratic Party and registered as an independent. Sinema was a lead co-sponsor of the bill, along with Baldwin and Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rob Portman of Ohio. She helped broker a compromise amendment about religious freedom protections that secured GOP votes for the underlying legislation.\n",
            "The amendment included language saying that religious organizations would not be required to perform same-sex marriages and that the federal government would not be required to protect polygamous marriages.\n",
            "A White House official said other attendees at the signing included Matthew Haynes, a co-owner of Club Q, the LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where five people were killed last month, and shooting survivors James Slaugh and Michael Anderson. Cyndi Lauper, the singer and longtime advocate for LGBTQ rights, performed the song “True Colors.”\n",
            "Other attendees included plaintiffs in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court's ruling in 2015 that guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage; Judy Kasen-Windsor, the widow of gay rights activist Edith Windsor; Philip Hirschkop, a co-counsel in Loving v. Virginia, the landmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling that protected interracial marriage; photographer Hunter Abrams; and Brandon Wolf, a survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida.\n",
            "The law comes after Democratic leaders expressed concern that the Supreme Court could follow its June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade with a ruling to rescind the right of same-sex couples to marry. Democrats pointed to Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion in the Supreme Court’s ruling on Roe, in which he called on the conservative-majority court to also revisit landmark decisions that legalized the right to contraception and same-sex marriage.\n",
            "The Respect for Marriage Act also comes as state legislators have proposed a record number of bills that would limit the rights of LGBTQ people in recent years. And amid widespread anti-LGBTQ rhetoric led by right-wing conservatives and a string of attacks on the community, including the deadly shooting at Club Q.\n",
            "Biden signed the bill Tuesday a decade after he came out in public support of same-sex marriage, a change for Biden, who had voted against recognition of same-sex marriages when he was a senator.\n",
            "“The good news is that, as more and more Americans become to understand, what this is all about is a simple proposition: Who do you love? Who do you love, and will you be loyal to the person you love? And that’s what people are finding out is what all marriages, at their root, are about, whether they’re marriages of lesbians or gay men or heterosexuals,\" Biden said in the “Meet the Press” interview in 2012.\n",
            "“I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties,” he added. “And quite frankly, I don’t see much of a distinction beyond that.”\n",

            "\n",
            "LIMA, Peru — A judge ordered ousted Peruvian President Pedro Castillo to remain in custody on Tuesday, denying his appeal as authorities build a rebellion case against him.\n",
            "Supreme Court Judge Cesar San Martin Castro’s decision could further inflame violent protests across the country, where people have been demanding Castillo’s freedom, the resignation of his successor and the immediate scheduling of general elections to pick a new president and replace all members of Congress.\n",
            "Castillo’s nationally televised announcement Wednesday that he had dissolved the Congress by presidential decree was “not a mere act of speech, but the concrete expression of a will to alter the constitutional system and the configuration of public powers,” the judge said.\n",
            "Later this week, prosecutors plan to seek Castillo’s continued detention for up to three years.\n",
            "Castillo claimed during his hearing earlier Tuesday that he is being “unjustly and arbitrarily detained” and thanked his supporters for their “effort and fight” since he was taken into custody.\n",
            "The judge said evidence suggests Castillo was intercepted as he tried to reach the Mexican embassy to seek asylum. He was taken into custody shortly after he was ousted by lawmakers when he sought to dissolve Congress ahead of an impeachment vote.\n",
            "“I will never renounce or abandon this popular cause that has brought me here,” Castillo said. Then, in apparent reference to the violent protests over his ouster, he urged the national police and armed forces to “lay down their arms and stop killing this people thirsty for justice.”\n",
            "The protests have been particularly violent outside Peru’s capital, Lima. The Ombudsman’s Office of Peru on Tuesday decreased to six the death toll from the demonstrations that began Wednesday. The office in a statement said it eliminated one person from the list after the national records’ agency determined the individual “does not exist.”\n",
            "All deaths happened in rural, impoverished communities — strongholds for Castillo, a political neophyte and former schoolteacher of peasant roots. Four of them occurred in Andahuaylas, a remote rural Andean community where the poor have struggled for years and where voters overwhelmingly supported Castillo during last year’s runoff election, which he won by 44,000 votes.\n",
            "Many businesses in that community remained closed on Tuesday, with streets blocked by burned tires, rocks and tree branches. About 3,000 people, including peasants from nearby villages and teachers, again marched calling for Boluarte’s resignation.\n",
            "A smaller group accompanied the coffin of a protester who died Monday of an apparent a gunshot wound.\n",
            "Shoe store owner Vilma Zúñiga put up a sign that read “Congress is the worst virus. Out with Dina Boluarte,” referring to Castillo’s successor. She and other merchants decided to close their doors, losing potential sales ahead of the holidays.\n",
            "Attorney Ronaldo Atencio, speaking for Castillo’s legal team, argued that he didn’t raise weapons or organize people capable of overturning the existing government, as Peruvian law requires for someone to be charged with rebellion. He also said Castillo doesn’t present a flight risk, and never sought asylum from Mexico, as confirmed by the Mexican ambassador.\n",
            "Boluarte, Castillo’s running mate and vice president, was swiftly sworn in Wednesday after Congress dismissed Castillo for “permanent moral incapacity.”\n",
            "On Monday, she acceded in part to protesters’ demands, announcing in a nationally televised address that she would send Congress a proposal to move up elections to April 2024. She had previously asserted that she aimed to remain president for the remaining 3 1/2 years of her predecessor’s term.\n",
            "In the streets of Lima, officers have doused protesters with tear gas and repeatedly beat them. Outside the capital, demonstrators burned police stations, took over an airstrip used by the armed forces and invaded the runway of the international airport in Arequipa, which is a gateway to some of Peru’s tourist attractions.\n",
            "The operator of the passenger train that transports visitors to Peru’s world-famous Machu Picchu site suspended service Tuesday. Meanwhile, trailer trucks remained stranded on the Pan-American Highway.\n",
            "Minister of Defense Luis Otarola Peñaranda said the national highway system would be declared under emergency “to ensure the free transit of all Peruvians.” He said the armed forces will also take over the safety of airports, hydroelectric power plants and other critical infrastructure.\n",
            "Otarola said government intelligence efforts have concluded that there are “no more than 8,000 (people) nationwide who are causing this disturbance.”\n",
            "The national police reported that 130 officers have been injured in clashes with demonstrators, according to state media.\n",
            "Boluarte on Tuesday begged protesters to calm down, explaining that she hadn’t sought the presidency.\n",
            "“I want to make a call to my brothers and sisters in Andahuaylas, calm down, calm down, please,” she said. “I don’t understand why my brothers... rise up against their compatriot Dina Boluarte when I haven’t done anything for that situation to exist or occur.”\n",
            "She spoke outside a hospital where a girl is being treated for an eye injury caused by a pellet fired during the protests. Boluarte said she had instructed the national police to not use any lethal weapons, “not even rubber bullets,” and that authorities are working to determine who used them to prosecute them.\n",
            "Boluarte’s struggles are not only within Peru’s borders. Regional governments have also refused to recognize her as Peru’s president.\n",
            "The governments of Colombia, Argentina, Mexico and Bolivia on Monday closed ranks in favor Castillo. In a joint statement, they expressed “deep concern” over his ouster and detention, said they still consider him Peru’s legitimate leader and requested that his human rights be respected and judicial protection guaranteed.\n",
            "Peru’s prime minister, Pedro Angulo, in a statement rejected the four governments’ position, which he attributed to an “ignorance of reality.”\n",

            "Every year the board selects 25 films to add to the registry based on its historical, cultural and aesthetic contributions.\n",
            "The 1950 version of “Cyrano de Bergerac” starring José Ferrer was the first American film adaptation of the French play of the same name from the late 1800s.\n",
            "His performance in the film made Ferrer the first Latino to win an Academy Award for best actor in 1951.\n",
            "The Puerto Rican actor had previously performed the same role on Broadway, earning him a Tony Award for best actor in 1946.\n",
            "“The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez,” released in 1982, is a film based on a folkloric figure from a popular early 1900s Mexican corrido. While the corrido, or ballad, has been richly embellished over time, it is based on actual events.\n",
            "The movie adaptation, starring Edward James Olmos as Gregorio Cortez, is considered one of the key feature films from the burgeoning 1980s Chicano film movement.\n",
            "It tells the story of Cortez, a Mexican American farmer who in 1901 was falsely accused of stealing a horse. After Cortez kills the sheriff who tried to arrest him, he escapes lynching before being captured and sentenced to more than a decade in prison.\n",
            "“Cyrano de Bergerac” and “The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez”join a growing list of movies included in the registry that highlight the contributions and history of Latinos in the United States.\n",
            "The 1997 biopic \"Selena,\" based on the inspirational and tragic story of late Tejano music star Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, was inducted into the National Film Registry last year after leaders from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus nominated 25 Latino films for inclusion in the registry.\n",
            "The initiative was led by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who chaired the caucus at the time, as part of a growing effort to fight Latino underrepresentation in Hollywood.\n",

            "LONDON — Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, took direct aim at the British royal family in the final instalment of their Netflix documentary series, accusing them of actively fueling negative media coverage that they said helped drive Meghan to suicidal thoughts and led the couple to leave the country.\n",
            "The first three episodes of the series, released last week, focused primarily on the treatment of Meghan by the media and racism, largely sparing Buckingham Palace any bombshells. But the final three episodes, released early Thursday, level significant criticism at the royal family — particularly Prince William, Harry’s brother and the heir to the throne.\n",
            "The new episodes illustrate just how acrimonious the couple's split from the family has been, focusing on their bombshell 2020 announcement that they would step back from royal duties.\n",
            "The couple accuse the royal family of not just failing to support them, but also of engaging in a briefing war in which negative stories were supplied to the media to protect other royals or leaked to protect the palace in what Harry calls a \"dirty game.\"\n",
            "The situation reached a boiling point in a crisis meeting at the royal Sandringham estate in January 2020 that Harry says saw William scream at him in front of Queen Elizabeth II.\n",
            "\"It was terrifying to have my brother scream and shout at me and have my father say things that simply weren't true, and my grandmother sit there and sort of take it all in,\" Harry tells the fifth installment of the six-hour-long docuseries.\n",
            "\"What this, I think, really busts open in a very dramatic and damaging way is how awful relations were and continue to be between the two brothers,\" the author and journalist Katie Nicholl told NBC's 'TODAY' after watching the final instalment Thursday.\n",
            "The last three episodes again repeatedly focus on the strain of being in the media spotlight — but this time the couple directly blame the royal institution and accuse the palace of complicity in their treatment.\n",
            "\"They had to believe it was more about us and maybe the issues that we had as opposed to their partner, the media, and their relationship, that was causing so much pain for us,\" Harry said of the royal family's coming to terms with the couple leaving front-line duties.\n",
            "After media reports suggested William's alleged bullying had forced the Sussexes out, a joint statement denying this was released by both William and Harry following the Sandringham summit.\n",
            "But Harry tells the documentary he knew nothing about this.\n",
            "\"I couldn’t believe it. No one had asked me to put my name to a statement like that,\" he said. \"I called M and she burst into flood of tears, because within four hours they were happy to lie to protect my brother and yet for three years they were never willing to tell the truth to protect us,\" he says.\n",
            "This was the moment, both Harry and Meghan said, they knew they had to leave. Harry said it was ultimately his decision to leave.\n",
            "Meghan said she \"did everything I could to make them proud and to really be a part of the family.\" But amid a storm of negative headlines, she said she \"wasn’t just being thrown to the wolves, I was being fed to the wolves.\"\n",
            "That line featured in trailers ahead of these final episodes, which promised to be more explosive than the first instalment.\n",
            "The public certainly appears to be watching.\n",
            "Netflix said that the first instalment was watched by 28 million households and viewed for more than 81.5 million hours, making it the streaming giant’s highest viewed documentary ever in a premiere week.\n",
            "The series does not seem to have had much of an impact on views of the couple in Britain, however. A poll released this week by the polling firm YouGov found that 4% of those asked now have a more positive view of the Sussexes, while 14 % now have a more negative view.\n",
            "The couple’s media output, which also includes a podcast series and a forthcoming book, has been criticized by many in the United Kingdom.\n",
            "Harry and Meghan are clearly keen to tell the story of their relationship and their rift with the royals from their perspective. The Sussexes’ media company, Archewell Productions, is listed as one of the Netflix show’s three producers.\n",
            "The series promised to reveal the “truth” about the rift pitting Hollywood glamor against the centuries-old institution.\n",
            "It comes at an awkward time for the monarchy, three months after Elizabeth’s death and the ascension of Harry’s father, Charles, as the king. \n",
            "The couple first outlined their side of the story in their bombshell interview with the media mogul Oprah Winfrey last year.\n",
            "Meghan said then that she had suicidal thoughts, and in the new Netflix series she expands on the mental health struggles she said she went through as a working royal — and the alleged lack of support from the palace.\n",
            "“I was like, all of this will stop if I’m not here. And that was the scariest thing about it. It was such clear thinking,\" she said.\n",
            "\"I wanted to go somewhere and get help but I wasn’t allowed to. They were concerned about how that would look for the institution,\" she alleged.\n",
            "Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, tells the docuseries: “I remember her telling that, that she wanted to take her own life. And that really broke my heart.\"\n",
            "NBC News approached Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace with a series of questions about claims made in the Netflix series, but has not received a response. Neither palace has yet to publicly comment on the series.\n",
            "Charles said on taking the throne that he wanted \"to express my love for Harry and Meghan as they continue to build their lives overseas,\" in an apparent attempt to signal a willingness to heal the rift between the monarchy and the Sussexes.\n",

            "Starting Thursday, the White House will make another round of free Covid tests available by allowing households to order up to four at-home tests from Covidtest.gov. After it failed to get additional funding from Congress to buy new tests, the White House will use money from the Covid stimulus bill passed last year to buy the additional tests, a senior administration official told reporters.\n",
            "While public health officials don’t expect a Covid surge as big as last winter’s, cases and deaths have increased since Thanksgiving. The administration official said the White House expects infections to continue to rise as more people gather indoors for holiday celebrations in the coming weeks.\n",
            "“We’re seeing Covid cases rising in parts of the country following Thanksgiving. And while Covid isn’t the disruptive force it once was, we know that the virus will circulate more quickly and easily as folks gather indoors for the winter holiday season,” the official said on a call with reporters.\n",
            "Hospitals are already struggling to deal with a surge of RSV and flu infections that have strained intensive care units. About 78,000 people have been hospitalized with the flu, and at least 4,500 have died, since the start of flu season in October, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
            "The White House will also make another push to encourage more high-risk people to get vaccinated, starting with nursing home staff members and residents, and expand the number of people allowed to administer shots to nursing home residents.\n",
            "Even though nursing home residents were widely vaccinated when the shots first rolled out, many have failed to get their recommended boosters. Just 45% of nursing home residents and 22% of staff members are up to date on their vaccinations, according to an analysis last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n",
            "The administration will also send more free at-home tests to food banks and low-income housing programs for seniors while working to increase distribution of the remaining 130 million N-95 masks that the White House released this year from the Strategic National Stockpile.\n",
            "But the federal government is also looking for states to play a role, urging governors to set up mobile and pop-up vaccination and testing sites, along with more test-to-treat sites where patients can be tested and get Pfizer’s Paxlovid treatment if they are infected. The senior administration official said the administration has distributed 6 million courses of Paxlovid to local communities and indicated that it is confident there will be enough supply to meet demand.\n",
            "“We have the tools, infrastructure and know-how we need to effectively manage this time to prevent hospitalizations and deaths, minimize disruptions and respond to challenges,” the official said. “Everyone just has to do their part.”\n",

NBC News has requested a copy of the warrant from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department but has not received it yet. \n",
            "This is not the first felony theft allegation leveled against Brinton. In October, they were placed on leave from their government position following an investigation into allegations that they stole a Vera Bradley suitcase from the baggage claim at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Sept. 16. \n",
            "The estimated value of the bag missing from the Minneapolis airport and its contents is $2,325, according to a complaint filed with Minnesota’s 4th Judicial District Court on Oct. 27.

Records show that Brinton did not check a bag when they departed Washington, D.C., for Minneapolis, the complaint states.\n",
            "Brinton initially denied knowingly taking anything that didn’t belong to them during a conversation with law enforcement Friday, but they called back a few hours later and said they hadn’t been “completely honest,” the complaint says. Brinton then said they were tired and took the Vera Bradley bag thinking it was theirs, and they only realized their mistake when they opened the bag at their hotel. \n",
            "Brinton said they became nervous that people would think they stole the bag, so they left the clothes from the bag inside the drawers of a hotel room and then took the bag back to the airport with them Sept. 18 and checked it, according to the complaint, which also stated that no clothing was recovered from the hotel room.\n",
            "In the Las Vegas case, police were unable to identify a suspect in airport surveillance footage until an officer saw a news article in November about the Minnesota incident involving Brinton, ABC affiliate KLAS-TV reported. \n",

            "In 2017, Brinton told NBC News that their parents sent them to a conversion therapist when they were 11, and that they were subjected to extreme and abusive techniques, such as electroshock therapy. \n",

Pediatric beds are at 74% occupancy, though seven states and Washington, D.C. have more than 90% of their pediatric beds full, according to an NBC News analysis of HHS data.\n",
            "Covid, flu and RSV can be difficult to distinguish, since they share many common symptoms. But it's useful to know which virus you have, since that determines the treatments you should receive and how long you should isolate.\n",
            "Certain hallmarks — either symptoms or how the illness progresses — can help differentiate each virus. Here are five factors to consider.\n",
            "A runny nose, cough, congestion or sore throat can arise because of any of the three viruses or a common cold. But a loss of taste and smell is more commonly associated with Covid than with flu or RSV. And wheezing is often a tell-tale sign of a serious RSV infection, usually found in kids or older adults.\n",
            "The only way to know for certain, though, is to get tested.\n",
            "\"I don’t think anybody would ever go, 'Hey, listen, I think you have a virus based on your symptoms,' and feel confident to say what virus that is,\" said Dr. Frank Esper, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic.\n",
            "Flu symptoms tend to develop more suddenly than those of Covid or RSV.\n",
            "\"Flu classically comes on with an abrupt fever first that happens pretty quickly. That’s somewhat contrasted by RSV and Covid, where we think of a slow escalation in symptoms,\" said Dr. Scott Roberts, a Yale Medicine infectious disease specialist.\n",
            "The illnesses have different incubation periods — the time between exposure and symptoms. On average, flu symptoms tend to develop two days after exposure to the virus, whereas RSV symptoms tend to take around four to six days to appear, and Covid's typical incubation is three to four days for the omicron variant.\n",
            "\"If I go to a party and I get symptoms the next day, it’s probably flu because that can be as short as 24 hours’ incubation period,\" Roberts said.\n",
            "RSV is unlikely to make a healthy adult feel very sick, whereas Covid and flu certainly can.\n",
            "\"In general, if you’re a young healthy adult or you’re not in an extreme of age, and you get pretty severe illness, it’s probably not RSV,\" Roberts said.\n",
            "The groups most vulnerable to severe RSV infections are babies, children with lung diseases, adults ages 65 and up and people with weakened immune systems.\n",
            "Symptoms can also look different depending on your age and immune status. Many kids are encountering respiratory viruses for the first time this year as they return to regular schooling and socializing, so their bodies may have a harder time clearing the infection, which can lead to more wide-ranging symptoms.\n",
            "According to Esper, almost a fourth of children have gastrointestinal symptoms — like diarrhea, stomach pain or vomiting — from viral infections. That's less common in adults with seasonal flu or RSV.\n",
            "People with weakened immune systems, meanwhile, are more likely to develop severe symptoms or pneumonia from any of the three viruses.\n",
            "Nationally, RSV infections appear to have passed their peak. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not keep precise count of RSV cases in the U.S., its data shows the number of positive weekly tests fell 75% in the last month, from nearly 20,000 in the week ending Nov. 12 to less than 5,000 last week.\n",
            "Roberts said the number of RSV cases at his hospital have halved since their peak in late October.\n",
            "Meanwhile, Covid cases are climbing as people travel and gather indoors for the holidays. Average daily cases reported to the CDC have risen nearly 45% over the last two weeks, according to NBC News’ tally.\n",
            "It's difficult to determine local Covid transmission levels, since many people use at-home tests. (RSV and flu tests, by contrast, are performed at a doctor’s office or ordered via prescription.) But Roberts said the Covid situation is “nowhere near the holiday omicron surge we saw last year,” though cases are “going in the wrong direction.”\n",
            "Flu cases may be reaching their peak. The national share of influenza tests coming back positive has hovered around 25% for at least two weeks. Flu hospitalizations are still the highest they've been at this time of year in more than a decade. \n",
            "The Cleveland Clinic said 30% of its flu tests are coming back positive, compared with 10% of its Covid tests and 5% of its RSV tests.\n",
            "Unlike Covid and the flu, there are no vaccines or universally prescribed treatments for RSV.\n",

            "\"I worry about the vulnerable groups — the very young and the very old and those with low immune systems — and their access to Tamiflu if they do get diagnosed,” he said. \"That's my biggest concern right now.\"\n",

            "HONG KONG — As China moves away from its strict “zero-Covid” controls, there has been a resurgence of online tributes to Li Wenliang, a whistleblower doctor who became a symbol of public dissatisfaction with the ruling Communist Party’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
            "Li, who worked at a hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan, was among eight doctors reprimanded by local police in early 2020 for “spreading rumors” after they warned colleagues about a new SARS-like disease that had recently emerged in the city. Weeks later, as the coronavirus shut down cities in China and began spreading around the world, Li died from the disease after contracting it at work. He was 33. \n",
            "Li’s death set off an online outpouring of grief and anger that is rarely seen in China, where there is little tolerance for dissent. Though Li was later officially exonerated and even held up as a national hero, criticism of the government in connection with his silencing and death has continued to be censored.\n",
            "This week, Chinese officials announced they were abandoning key pillars of President Xi Jinping’s “zero-Covid” strategy, including broad lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine in centralized government facilities. Many social media users rushed to tell Li, flooding his profile on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, with expressions of gratitude, celebration and grief.\n",
            "“It’s been three years, Dr. Li, it’s over,” read a typical comment.\n",
            "“Dr. Li, in the past three years, I often think of you at night. I burst into tears every time,” another commenter wrote from Sichuan province.\n",
            "The latest easing of restrictions comes after mass protests across China against the “zero-Covid” controls, with some demonstrators calling for Xi to step down. While the measures have minimized deaths — 5,235 in China, compared with more than a million in the United States — they have exhausted the public as lagging vaccinations prevented them from transitioning to “living with the virus” as so many other countries have done.\n",
            "“The epidemic is over, and so is my youth,” a commenter from the Inner Mongolia region said on Li’s page. \n",
            "Others expressed anxiety about the explosion in cases that is likely coming in a population of 1.4 billion that has barely been exposed to the virus.\n",
            "“Three years later, friends around me are testing positive one after another, and the epidemic has entered a new stage,” read one comment from Beijing. \n",
            "Some Weibo users vowed to make Li proud as case numbers rise.\n",
            "“I hope that the living comrades will not let you down, and the virus will be gone soon,” a commenter from Jiangsu province said. “Thank you, we are grateful to have had you and you’ll always be remembered.”\n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "The likely imminent approval of U.S. advanced air defense systems for Ukraine could offer a much-needed boost for its forces and a timely show of support from its allies as the country endures a long and difficult winter.\n",
            "Washington is poised to satisfy Kyiv's long-held and repeated request by sending Patriot missile systems, fulfilling its promise to further bolster Ukraine’s ability to thwart repeated Russian attacks on both its military sites and civilian infrastructure.\n",
            "Approval of the plan by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is likely to come later this week, with an announcement possible as early as Thursday, three U.S. officials told NBC News.\n",
            "The system will not only give Ukraine vital new strength to defend its cities against missile attacks, but it also illustrates that the Kremlin’s grinding effort has done little to erode Western support for Kyiv’s cause, military analysts said. After a flurry of stunning Ukrainian victories on the ground, the news also hints at a recognition that conditions have shifted the war’s focus to the air as winter has set in.Patriot — the U.S. armed forces’ main surface-to-air weapon, which is also used across the world — is an acronym describing how its targeting system works for Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target.\n",
            "Patriot systems typically require crews of up to 90 to undergo at least 10 weeks of training, although as few as three soldiers can fire it if necessary, the U.S. Army has said, and Ukrainian armed forces have previously defied expectations in terms of how quickly their troops have learned to use Western weaponry.  \n",
            "Ukraine’s bitter winter is being felt across the country, with many areas without power or heating after bombardment by Russian forces destroyed power plants, lines and substations. Temperatures were set to reach as low as 21 degree Fahrenheit on Wednesday night in the capital.\n",
            "The cold weather and the onset of thick mud, a notable obstacle for the invading Russian vehicles at the start of the war in February, are expected to slow combat operations on the ground, but aerial strikes and drone attacks have so far continued.\n",
            "The war has become, in the eyes of some Western officials, a battle over who has the most ammunition.\n",
            "Experts said the likely Patriot offer comes after months of intense Russian attacks that have pushed Ukrainian defenses, mostly Cold War-era equipment it inherited from the breakup of the Soviet Union, to beyond their limit.\n",
            "“As we move into the winter, the amount of maneuver operations on the ground in the war is going to decrease for all the reasons that we know, weather, conditions and so on,” Jonathan Eyal, an associate director at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London, told NBC News.\n",
            "“So it’s very likely Russia is going to keep up pressure from the air by trying to systematically destroy Ukrainian infrastructure. So it is therefore very important for Ukraine’s Western backers to look again at Ukraine’s air defenses. The timing is important,” he said.\n",
            "Early Wednesday, existing Ukrainian air defenses shot down 13 Iranian-made Shahed drones in the nation's capital, the Kyiv City Military Administration said on its Telegram channel. Senior U.S. officials believe Russia is providing unprecedented military and technical support to Iran in exchange for weapons.\n",
            "Patriot missiles don’t solve the problem of drones, which are too small to be detected by most air defense systems, Eyal added, but the new weapons do provide an important additional air defense layer to the Ukrainian military.\n",
            "Also, given the grinding, attritional nature of the war — now more than 300 days old — the supply of state-of-the-art weapons shows that Ukraine’s Western backers will not tolerate Russian President Vladimir Putin’s repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure.\n",
            "“The political message to the Russians is that they can’t continue destroying Ukraine’s infrastructure with impunity, which is what Putin does every day. They can’t do that without the West delivering better and more sophisticated weapons to the Ukrainian military,” Eyal said.\n",
            "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who is the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, has said that should Washington provide Kyiv with Patriot systems, they would become legitimate military targets.\n",
            "Asked whether he agreed with this at his daily press briefing Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “Definitely,” before saying he was waiting for more information before commenting further.\n",
            "Ukraine has been asking for increased surface-to-air firepower since long before Moscow's full-scale invasion this year.\n",
            "As Russian tanks rolled across the border in February, current and former American officials and defense experts told NBC News that a number of fears — including that weapons could provoke Russia or fall into Russian hands — prevented the U.S. and its allies from granting the Ukrainian requests.\n",
            "For some analysts, this reluctance was the result of a Russian campaign to intimidate the West, which is only now being ignored.\n",
            "“This is another step in the U.S. steadily overcoming Russia’s successful efforts at deterring it from aiding Ukraine,” said Keir Giles, an expert on Russia and a consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London think tank. \n",
            "“We’ve seen an incremental process of the U.S. supplying more essential capabilities to Ukraine as it becomes clear that Russia’s ‘red lines’ are no more than bluff and bluster, like so much of the Kremlin’s rhetoric,” he said. \n",
            "Giles added that the Patriot missiles offer from the U.S. was also a recognition that the nature of the war has changed: from a series of ground offensives in an attempt to capture major cities in February, to bombarding civilian centers and struggling to retain captured territory now.\n",
            "“The vital battle for the future of Ukraine is not on the front line — instead it is in protecting the civilian population and key centers from Russia’s drone and missile campaign designed to end Ukrainian resistance by making the country uninhabitable,” he said.\n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "Japan, the United Kingdom and Italy have finally made official a merger of their separate but parallel programs to domestically develop a next-generation fighter plane. Earlier dubbed the Tempest in the U.K. and F-X in Japan, it will combine stealth characteristics with powerful sensors, artificial intelligence-enhanced pilot assistance, drone control capability and advanced engines that could eventually power laser weapons. The so-called Global Combat Air Program aims to launch a first flight by 2027 and operational aircraft by 2035. \n",
            "The merger is a smart choice for the participating countries given the immense costs and technical risks each country faces bringing such a difficult project to completion alone — earlier estimated to amount at least $48 billion for Japan and around $30 billion for the U.K. For the U.S., it’s a missed opportunity for domestic businesses that ironically stems from a misguided effort to keep technology in American hands. The silver lining is that this foreign collaboration will benefit America’s trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific security alliances.\n",
            "The silver lining is that this foreign collaboration will benefit America’s trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific security alliances.\n",
            "Japan in particular wants a jet specialized in rapidly intercepting hostile bombers and defeating enemy fighters in air-to-air combat, as Japan has been approached two or three times daily by China’s larger air force in recent years. Meanwhile, the U.K.’s fleet of non-stealth Typhoon fighters will reach the end of their service lives by the 2040s, which Italy uses as well. \n",
            "The U.S.-made F-22 — which, unlike the newer F-35s being procured by all three countries, specialized in air-to-air combat — was exactly what Japan wanted for home defense. But the U.S. missed this opportunity for sales and co-development with Japan for reasons dating back to a quarter century ago. \n",
            "In the mid-1990s, revelations that Israel may have shared U.S. fighter technology with China led Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wisc., to sponsor an amendment banning the not-yet-in-service F-22 stealth fighter from being exported. The idea was to avoid the fighter’s state-of-the-art technology ever being leaked by a friend to a potential foe. \n",
            "Unfortunately, this contributed to a negative outcome for the U.S. as well as its potential foreign partners. With no hope of building more planes to sell abroad, each F-22 made for the U.S. Air Force had a high unit price. That contributed to the total order being drastically downsized and the production line being closed early. The high costs may also lead to the F-22’s relatively early retirement.\n",
            "Obey’s one-off amendment was well-intended but misguided in its sweeping scope. It’s true some U.S. defense partners maintain significant partnerships with potential military adversaries or may use U.S. arms in objectionable ways. In such cases, denying export of cutting-edge technologies is not only justified but vital. \n",
            "But countries like the U.K. and Japan are closer, more reliable allies with whom the U.S. already regularly shares sensitive technologies and intelligence. It’s unavoidable that some risks in sharing technologies remain, but those risks must be weighed against the benefits.\n",
            "These begin with the second, implicit objective of the collaborative jet program: to maintain the specialized industrial base and human resources to develop and manufacture jet fighters into the mid-21st century, as those can evaporate without production to keep manufacturers solvent and necessary expertise employed. If that happens, it could become impossible to rebuild domestic fighter production capacity fast enough to respond to a crisis.\n",
            "If Tokyo, Rome and London can together overcome the admittedly nontrivial hurdles of cooperative development, then they may lower both research and development and procurement costs considerably, and come out with a better overall fighter using the best systems from each country — something that would be cost-prohibitive and have higher risk of failure if they acted on their own.\n",
            "Now, this does spell some trouble for U.S. defense giants — if the only concern is their bottom line. The merger presumably sidelines Japan’s planned partnership with U.S. firm Lockheed Martin, and a successful Tempest would compete for export orders with U.S. aircraft.\n",
            "But it’s good for U.S. national security when our allies and partners retain an independent defense technology base rather than allowing their indigenous industries to atrophy.\n",
            "For starters, competition drives innovation and results in a diversity of technological solutions that reduce vulnerability to unforeseen circumstances than when uniformly relying on a single platform. Even with the United States’ huge defense sector, foreign partners still end up contributing technical solutions to the U.S. military, such as the main guns on the U.S. Patton and Abrams tanks (from the U.K. and Germany), the AT4 anti-tank launcher (from Sweden) and even the Navy’s next-generation frigate (based on an Italian vessel). Having additional options on the market can also deprive U.S. adversaries of export sales, reducing their influence.\n",
            "The U.S. often has reason to gripe that its partners don’t contribute their fair share to mutual defense.\n",
            "Furthermore, having multiple manufacturers creates more production capacity across our defense alliances, reducing the obstacles imposed by industrial bottlenecks. For example, while Washington may want to sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, U.S. submarine builders barely have capacity to meet U.S. Navy orders. And Poland recently bought tanks and aircraft from South Korea instead of Germany and the U.S. because both apparently had too large a backlog of orders.\n",
            "Lastly, both the U.S. and its allies find it politically easier to invest in their own defenses when they’re procuring platforms from domestic companies, meaning their payments boost their own economy. That’s a win considering the U.S. often has reason to gripe that its partners don’t contribute their fair share to mutual defense. And for that matter, U.S. companies aren’t losing out entirely: The Defense Department says it’s working with Japan on “autonomous” capabilities (i.e. drones) that could “complement” the new jet.\n",
            "It’s unfortunate we’re entering a period of heightened tensions in which the risks of conflict compel heightened defense spending. But Russia’s war in Ukraine has shown the risks are real.\n",
            "This leads to a seemingly contradictory dynamic. The U.S. can advance its own security interests through exports and tech transfers to foreign partners who can be trusted to use such arms defensively. However, Washington’s interests are also served when allies maintain a robust ability to produce their own security goods.\n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "Films about lesbians don’t tend to end well. From the 1936 film “Dracula’s Daughter,” about a female vampire  who secretly craves women, to 1961’s “The Children’s Hour,” where a schoolteacher played by Shirley MacLaine commits suicide after she’s accused of being a lesbian, to 2003’s “Monster,” for which Charlize Theron won an Oscar for playing a street prostitute and killer who dies by lethal injection, there are no happy endings.\n",
            "Why did Field create Tár as a lesbian rather than a straight woman, or one of the great men themselves? The film wouldn't be as fascinating, as psychologically intriguing.\n",
            "As a rule, in these films and dozens of others, lesbians live miserable lives (see “Ammonite” with Kate Winslet). They are ostracized and endure tragic, heartbreaking relationships (“Portrait of a Lady on Fire”). The films, however sympathetic, leave us with images of toxic women, broken relationships and sad endings, even if much of the misery is due to other people’s cruelty and prejudice.\n",
            "Now we have “Tár,” with the magnificent Cate Blanchett playing Lydia Tár, her second major role as a lesbian after her Oscar-nominated turn in “Carol.” She was recognized for her standout performance on Monday with a Golden Globe nomination, and Oscar consideration is sure to follow. The movie also received a best motion picture and best screenplay nod.\n",
            " In \"Tár,\" Blanchett plays the Berlin Philharmonic’s fictional director, an artistic genius and intimidating force. She is in her 50s, with an eye for pretty female underlings and protégées who seem willing to reciprocate but, like nearly everyone else around her, fear her and her rejection. Even if there’s no physical force, the power equation is not in the young women’s favor. Once Tár is done, she brushes them off and turns against them, ruining their careers.\n",
            "The decision by director and screenwriter Todd Field to make Tár a lesbian unsettled me. I feared that the film would perpetuate a negative toxic lesbian stereotype. But I changed my mind after seeing it. The film’s core is not so much about a lesbian predator but about the more general use and abuse of power, including sexual power, that Lydia wields at will. \n",
            "But it also explores how that power comes to hurt Lydia as well. Her arrogance and control of an elite world where she is unchallenged blind her to herself and her sexual games. There’s little question that her young female peons are drawn to her, attracted to her power and desire her desire. So when, toward the end of the film, a young cellist rejects her, it comes as a shock.\n",
            "Blanchett’s Tár also doesn’t realize that her relationships with these young women are abusive, no more that she sees her cruel mistreatment of her veteran assistants as abuse either. In her eyes, she is only asserting privilege, like the great men she admires and tries to imitate, who enjoyed unchecked power, who walked through a room as if they owned it. She doesn’t think about the limits of her power because she has no limits. She believes that her artistic brilliance excuses her disruptive force, her sexual misconduct, her infidelity, even the scary way she bullies a schoolmate of her adopted daughter.\n",
            "So why did Field create Tár as a lesbian rather than a straight woman, or one of the great men themselves? The film wouldn’t be as fascinating, as psychologically intriguing. We have seen not a few films about overpowering men and scheming, seductive straight women. \"Tár\" is different, daring to put a lesbian in the role of genius and villain. At the same time, this choice is in some ways an equalizer: Relationships among all sexes and genders should be on equal footing and giving critical examination to a lesbian character helps do so.\n",
            "Of course, Blanchett’s Tár has no equal in her rarefied intellectual and artistic world. Everything about her is exceptional: her sexuality, her genius, her career, her custom-made suits. From the outset, her character occupies center stage, literally. The film opens at the elite New Yorker Festival, where the writer Adam Gopnik, playing himself, recites a long list of her accomplishments while she listens smiling, relaxed in her chair, supremely at ease in her body, in that company.\n",
            "And why not? She is the first female chief conductor of the great Berlin Philharmonic, she has won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards, is publishing an autobiography titled — what else? — “Tár on Tár,” and is soon to conduct a landmark live recording of Gustav Mahler’s “Symphony No. 5.” Her intoxication with herself, her grandeur, her passion for music (the only true passion she feels) makes everyone around her small, insignificant.\n",
            "Tár’s relationship with her assistant Francesca (Noémie Merlant of “Portrait of a Lady on Fire”) is a case in point. Francesca has musical ambitions and depends on Tár to help her career. It’s not clear that they had a sexual connection, but we assume they did, and now that Tár has tired of her, Francesca is sidelined, a nobody.\n",
            "But it turns out that Tár can’t shake these underlings so easily. She is hounded by a former protégée and paramour, Krista, whom we see only in flashes. Tár has dumped Krista, and refuses to see her, but Krista pleads, sends gifts. When Krista commits suicide, the inquest looks into her relationship with Tár, threatening Tár’s untouchable reputation. \n",
            "It seems nearly impossible to envision anyone else in the role. The Golden Globes’ judges will err if they don’t choose her for the highest acting honors.\n",
            "In the end, though, it’s Tár’s own appetites that do her in. When she falls for a young Russian cellist, Olga, who has just arrived in Berlin, she passes over a senior cellist to give Olga the coveted spot. But once she gets what she wants, Olga rejects Tár. So begins the end.    \n",
            "Despite this affair and Tár’s other seductions, the film is not about a predatory lesbian. The sexual aspect is only one element. Over two hours and 38 minutes, “Tár” has no graphic sex scenes, and the main character’s affairs seem like dalliances rather than all-consuming passions. In the end, we are not sure she is really guilty of sexual harassment and abuse, whether she deserves public condemnation.\n",
            "Does the film, and Blanchett specifically, change the negative image of  lesbians on screen? I think it does. It gives us a conflicted, multifaceted image, one that’s more compelling and complex, more alluring. It has almost everything to do with how Blanchett conveys that in her performance. Her Lydia Tár is almost irresistible, and it seems nearly impossible to envision anyone else in the role. The Golden Globes’ judges will err if they don’t choose her for the highest acting honors.\n",
            "“She burns like a cool flame,” The New Yorker critic Anthony Lane wrote. Even in the final scenes, when there’s so little of the fire left in her, she has an aura, a defiant presence. She stays with you long after the screen goes black. It’s a searing image, with its ravages and greatness, that defies stereotypes and is simply about being human.\n",

            "The 54 shootings, from murder-suicides to snipers to slaughters, happened across 25 states and Washington, D.C. Sometimes the shooter is an angry student, sometimes it’s an angry adult. Almost always the shooter is male. And despite the devastation, the prayerful vigils and the pleas for change, not a long time passes until another shooting occurs.

            "'Firmageddon': Researchers find 1.1 million acres of dead trees in Oregon\n",
            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "Drought-stricken Oregon saw a historic die-off of fir trees in 2022 that left hillsides once lush with green conifers dotted with patches of red, dead trees. \n",
            "The damage to fir trees was so significant researchers took to calling the blighted areas “firmageddon” as they flew overhead during aerial surveys that estimated the die-off’s extent. \n",
            "The surveyors ultimately tallied about 1.1 million acres of Oregon forest with dead firs, the most damage recorded in a single season since surveys began 75 years ago. \n",
            "Oregon’s dead firs are a visceral example of how drought is reshaping landscapes in Western states that have been experiencing extreme heat conditions. In many areas, these firs might be replaced by more drought-hardy species in the future, reshaping how ecosystems function and changing their character. \n",
            "“When I looked at it and crunched the numbers, it was almost twice as bad as far as acres impacted than anything we had previously documented,” said Danny DePinte, an aerial survey program manager for the U.S. Forest Service. “Nature is selecting which trees get to be where during the drought.” \n",
            "Oregon is known for towering volcanic domes covered by a blanket of conifers that becomes sparse and patchwork on the eastern side of the Cascade Mountains before it tucks into the high desert. \n",
            "The people who know the trees best say there are many signs of problems in Oregon.\n",
            "“We’re seeing forms of stress in all of our species of trees,” said Christine Buhl, a forest entomologist with the Oregon Department of Forestry. “We just need to shift our expectations of what tree species we can expect to be planted where.”\n",
            "Researchers have been surveying Pacific Northwest forests by air since 1947. Little about the process has changed during that time, according to Glenn Kohler, an entomologist with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, which operates the program alongside the U.S. Forest Service and Oregon Department of Forestry. \n",
            "Each summer, small high-wing planes soar about 1,000 feet above the tree canopy at about 100 mph. Trained observers peer outside both sides of the plane, looking for noticeable damage to trees. \n",
            "Dead trees — conifers that are completely red or orange — are the easiest to spot, but the observers can also pinpoint trees that are barren of needles in some areas. \n",
            "The observers rate the intensity of damage and map its location. Pilots fly in a grid pattern with flight lines about 4 miles apart to cover every swath of the forest.  \n",
            "“It’s literally like mowing the lawn,” Kohler said of the flight trajectory. \n",
            "Paper maps of the past have been replaced today by Samsung Galaxy tablets that track the plane’s progress and make mapping easier — and probably more accurate. \n",
            "Observers require a season of training, Kohler said. It can be a dizzying task. \n",
            "“We’re analyzing 16-30 acres per second,” DePinte said, noting that small planes can offer a more turbulent ride. “You definitely have to have a stomach of steel.” \n",
            "This year, the aerial observation program flew over about 69 million acres of Washington and Oregon forest in about 246 hours.  \n",
            "“We’re just really painting the picture. It’s not hard science. You’re not counting individual trees or inspecting individual trees. The purpose is — what are the major trends and to detect outbreaks,” Kohler said.\n",
            "The scale of damage in Oregon, which was first reported by the environmental journalism nonprofit Columbia Insight, was staggering to the researchers and begs for a more thorough study. \n",
            "“We had never seen anything to this level,” DePinte said. “It sets you back and makes you pause. Your scientific mind starts questioning why. We don’t always have the answers.”\n",
            "Trees are susceptible to bark beetles, root diseases and defoliators like caterpillars. Aerial surveys help researchers capture the booms and busts of these pathogens. \n",
            "Healthy trees typically can defend themselves against these threats. When beetles drill into a trees’ bark, for example, a healthy tree can push the beetles out by excreting pitch, a gooey substance, where they entered the tree, Kohler said. \n",
            "But disturbances like drought, wildfire and windstorms can stress trees and weaken their defenses. Large numbers of dead and dying trees could allow bark beetles to lay eggs, feed their larvae and flourish.  \n",
            "Scientists still only have a coarse understanding of the factors that are causing widespread die-offs in Oregon, but many view drought as the underlying culprit. \n",
            "“There are multiple factors at play here. One of the things most of us agree on: The primary factor we have going on here is hot drought,” Buhl said, meaning that the state has been hampered by higher-than-normal temperatures and also low precipitation. \n",
            "DePinte said damage was most pronounced in White, Shasta and Red firs on the eastern side of the Cascade Mountain range’s crest, where the climate is drier. \n",
            "Nearly half of Oregon is experiencing severe, extreme or exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The drought is worse in eastern Oregon. \n",
            "Oregon’s average temperatures have risen about 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895, according to a 2021 state climate assessment delivered to the state’s Legislature. The severity of drought has increased over the past two decades in part because of human-caused climate change, the report says. Summers in Oregon are expected to become warmer and drier. \n",
            "“We’ve been hearing about climate change for some time. Climate change is happening. We’re now feeling it,” Buhl said. “These summers are getting warm and long. We’re seeing evidence on the landscape. We needed to pay more attention decades ago, but we didn’t.” \n",
            "Buhl said impacts to forest health are taking out roughly as many trees as wildfires, which are also now  more likely and more intense by climate change. \n",
            "Heat waves are a growing threat, too. On Oregon’s west side, trees were scorched by the June 2021 heat dome, which sent Portland’s temperature as high as 116. Scientists have said the intense heat wave was “virtually impossible” without climate change.\n",
            "Aerial assessments last year documented nearly 230,000 acres of heat scorch across Oregon and Washington, DePinte said. Most of the damage was on hillsides with south-facing aspects that soak up more sunlight because of the sun’s angle in the sky. \n",
            "“It was the combination of the high temperatures in the afternoon with the sun boring down,” said Chris Still, a professor in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University. “We think a lot of those leaves just cooked in place.”\n",
            "Still speculated that the heat dome could have contributed to this year’s fir die-off, also, but more research and evidence is needed to examine any possible connection. \n",
            "DePinte said the 2021 scorching was the largest ever recorded, which means the Pacific Northwest has now seen two events of record-breaking damage in its forests in as many years. \n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "Two years after the first Covid shots went into arms, a growing chorus of researchers is calling for a new generation of vaccines that provide broader and more long-term protection against the disease.\n",
            "The U.S. is currently recording around 430 Covid deaths per day, on average, according to NBC News’ tally. That includes many people who received at least two Covid shots: Six in 10 adults who died of Covid in August were vaccinated or boosted, according to a report by KFF, a nonprofit health think tank. And for the most part, vaccinated people don’t avoid infections or reinfections anymore.\n",
            "“Coming up with a vaccine that’s going to last longer and cover a wider range of the Covid family of viruses is a life and death problem,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, who directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention until 2017 and is now president of the public health organization Resolve to Save Lives.\n",
            "Many people thought the solution to that problem had arrived two years ago, on December 14, 2020, when Sandra Lindsay became the first person in the U.S. to get a Covid vaccine outside of a clinical trial.\n",
            "“My whole life just changed tremendously in that one moment in time,” said Lindsay, who is now the vice president of public health advocacy at Northwell Health.\n",
            "“What was going through my mind is, ‘I cannot wait for this needle to pierce my arm,’” she said.\n",
            "Millions of people shared her impatience, for good reason: Adults who are up to date on their shots are 15 times less likely to die from Covid than those who are unvaccinated. Covid vaccines prevented more than 3.2 million deaths and 18.5 million hospitalizations in the U.S. from December 2020 through November 2022, according to an analysis published Tuesday by the Commonwealth Fund and Yale School of Public Health.\n",
            "But at first, the shots were perceived to be even more powerful than that — a shield against mild symptoms and a ticket back to pre-pandemic life. The reality proved more complicated and, in certain ways, disappointing.\n",
            "Many experts maintain that we can — and must — do better.\n",
            "In particular, researchers think sprays or drops given through the nose or mouth could do a better job of stopping transmission. They also hope that vaccines that target multiple parts of the virus or several variants at once could reduce the need for continuous boosters.\n",
            "“It’s sometimes easy to forget what a tremendous achievement it was to get a brand new vaccine against a brand new class of viruses. … It was pragmatic, and it was tremendously successful. But it’s certainly not the panacea,” said Matthew Miller, scientific director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University. “We can certainly improve on what we know now.”\n",
            "Vaccine researchers generally agree that mRNA technology was suited to the needs of this pandemic, since it allowed scientists to develop a vaccine quickly at a time when each day meant more lives lost. Scientists then updated the shots relatively easily to target new variants.\n",
            "“If it wasn’t mRNA, it wouldn’t have gotten done so fast,” said Dr. Barney Graham, former deputy director of the National Institutes of Health’s Vaccine Research Center, now a senior adviser for global health equity at Morehouse School of Medicine. \n",
            "To date, he added, the Covid vaccine is “one of our simplest, safest vaccines that we’ve ever made.”\n",
            "When Lindsay got her vaccine in 2020, she was dealing with severely ill Covid patients every day as director of nursing critical care at Long Island Jewish Medical Center.\n",
            "“It felt like you were just walking into a burning building, but it’s your job,” she said. “It’s what I love doing: taking care of people. So I was going in there no matter what, and just praying every day that I don’t fall ill.”\n",
            "Despite the odds, Lindsay still hasn’t gotten Covid, as far as she knows. But the majority of Americans have, according to CDC estimates — a situation most of the public did not anticipate when clinical trial results showed 95% efficacy against symptomatic disease.\n",
            "“It may be that the vaccines were their own worst enemies in some ways, because they were so good initially that people had an expectation that went beyond reason,” Graham said.\n",
            "Experts agree now, though, that protection from Covid shots fades too fast. Plus, a lack of access to vaccines in many countries allowed the virus to spread rampantly and mutate over time, which has undermined vaccines and treatments.\n",
            "“If we had immunized the whole world in six months, we may not be having all the problems with the variants because we would have constrained [the] virus’ spread earlier,” Graham said.\n",
            "When Lindsay volunteered to get her vaccine on day one, she wasn’t aware that she was the country’s very first recipient — despite the cameras.\n",
            "Now, she said, she still gets recognized.\n",
            "“I was in TJ Maxx the other day and this man who I didn’t expect was basically bowing down at my feet, [saying] that through my one action, I saved his life, his family’s lives, and so many more,” Lindsay said. “Those are the stories that just solidify for me that what I did on that day made a big difference.”\n",
            "But others see Lindsay as the face of a promise that fell short. \n",
            "“You get this on social media, when you post anything: ‘Well, how do you feel now that this thing was all a lie? People are not supposed to get Covid and you got the shots and it’s a big letdown,’” she said.\n",
            "Researchers still hope that in the future, nasal spray vaccines could inspire more confidence by offering more protection against illness, reducing side effects and removing needles from the equation. \n",
            "Because Covid seems to infect most people through the nasal passages first, administering a vaccine in the nose could vanquish the virus before it has a chance to spread, the thinking goes.\n",
            "“It’s sort of akin to having guards placed outside the door in the mucus layer, versus waiting for the invaders to come in,” said Dr. Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiology professor at Yale University who is developing an intranasal Covid vaccine.\n",
            "Globally, 117 intranasal Covid vaccines are in development or have been rolled out, according to an analysis provided to NBC News by Airfinity, a health analytics company. Five have been approved in at least one country — two in China and one each in India, Iran and Russia — and 20 more have entered clinical trials. The majority rely on traditional vaccine platforms, not mRNA.\n",
            "“There’s probably a number of advantages to the intranasal route that will be realized once that route is fully exploited. People can administer it themselves. You can use it in a developing world setting. You can use lower doses,” said Dr. David Curiel, a professor of radiation oncology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “There may even be a safety gain, and you get sterilizing immunity and possibly block transmission.”\n",
            "Curiel developed the technology for the nasal vaccine approved in India. But the vaccine hasn’t entered trials in the U.S., and trial results from India haven’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n",
            "Other researchers are betting on inhaled vaccines, which come in the form of aerosolized mists administered through a nebulizer into the lungs, where the virus tends to wreak the most havoc.\n",
            "In September, China approved an inhaled version of a previously authorized Covid shot, called Convidecia. A small trial showed that the inhaled booster dose produced a stronger antibody response than a booster of the intramuscular shot.\n",
            "Miller and his McMaster colleagues are testing two inhaled vaccines in phase 1 human trials. The more effective candidate will likely advance to phase 2, he said.\n",
            "Those vaccines might offer an additional advantage, according to Miller: They target three parts of the coronavirus, whereas the current shots target just the spike protein, which mutates faster than the virus’ other components.\n",
            "Still, some researchers worry that protection from nasal or inhaled vaccines could also wane quickly.\n",
            "“If we can give a vaccine at the site where infection typically occurs, we would always love to do it that way. The challenge, of course, is that sometimes it doesn’t generate the same type of bloodstream immunity that we really want,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program.\n",
            "Creech said future versions of mRNA shots could potentially be tweaked to target three or more coronavirus strains. (The new bivalent boosters target two.)\n",
            "“It will not be surprising if at some point we need something like a trivalent vaccine or some other permutation of what we have now,” he said. “It could very well mirror what we do with influenza.”\n",
            "Then there’s the idea of targeting several different coronaviruses at once. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has allocated more than $62 million for research and development of pan-coronavirus vaccines. \n",

            "\n",
            "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — What’s a dust devil sound like on Mars? A NASA rover by chance had its microphone on when a whirling tower of red dust passed directly overhead, recording the racket.\n",
            "It’s about 10 seconds of not only rumbling gusts of up to 25 mph, but the pinging of hundreds of dust particles against the rover Perseverance. Scientists released the first-of-its-kind audio Tuesday.\n",
            "It sounds strikingly similar to dust devils on Earth, although quieter since Mars’ thin atmosphere makes for more muted sounds and less forceful wind, according to the researchers.\n",
            "The dust devil came and went over Perseverance quickly last year, thus the short length of the audio, said the University of Toulouse’s Naomi Murdoch, lead author of the study appearing in Nature Communications. At the same time, the navigation camera on the parked rover captured images, while its weather-monitoring instrument collected data.\n",
            "“It was fully caught red-handed by Persy,” said co-author German Martinez of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.\n",
            "Photographed for decades at Mars but never heard until now, dust devils are common at the red planet. This one was in the average range: at least 400 feet tall and 80 feet across, traveling at 16 feet per second.\n",
            "The microphone picked up 308 dust pings as the dust devil whipped by, said Murdoch, who helped build it.\n",
            "Given that the rover’s SuperCam microphone is turned on for less than three minutes every few days, Murdoch said it was “definitely luck” that the dust devil appeared when it did on Sept. 27, 2021. She estimates there was just a 1-in-200 chance of capturing dust-devil audio.\n",
            "Of the 84 minutes collected in its first year, there’s “only one dust devil recording,” she wrote in an email from France.\n",
            "This same microphone on Perseverance’s mast provided the first sounds from Mars — namely the Martian wind — soon after the rover landed in February 2021. It followed up with audio of the rover driving around and its companion helicopter, little Ingenuity, flying nearby, as well as the crackle of the rover’s rock-zapping lasers, the main reason for the microphone.\n",
            "These recordings allow scientists to study the Martian wind, atmospheric turbulence and now dust movement as never before, Murdoch said. The results \"demonstrate just how valuable acoustic data can be in space exploration.\"\n",
            "On the prowl for rocks that might contain signs of ancient microbial life, Perseverance has collected 18 samples so far at Jezero Crater, once the scene of a river delta. NASA plans to return these samples to Earth a decade from now. The helicopter Ingenuity has logged 36 flights, the longest lasting almost three minutes.\n",

            "According to a filing on Wednesday tied to FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings, Salame disclosed “possible mishandling of clients’ assets” by Bankman-Fried. The letter included in the filing was dated Nov. 9, and was sent from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas to the commissioner of police. FTX declared bankruptcy on Nov. 11.\n",

            "\n",
            "Several children's hospitals in the U.S. have detected increases in invasive group A strep infections, a severe and sometimes life-threatening illness that occurs when bacteria spread to areas of the body that are normally germ-free, such as the bloodstream.\n",
            "Children's hospitals in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Washington told NBC News they are seeing higher-than-average numbers of cases this season compared to past years.\n",
            "Dr. James Versalovic, the pathologist-in-chief at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, said his facility — the largest pediatric hospital in the U.S. — has seen \"a greater than fourfold increase\" in potentially invasive infections in the last two months compared to the same period last year.\n",
            "Texas Children’s recorded around 60 cases in October and November, he said.\n",
            "In the U.K., at least 15 children have died from invasive group A strep since mid-September. The U.K. Health Security Agency said in an advisory last week that cases tend to rise sharply in the new year but appear to have spiked earlier than expected.\n",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, said it is “hearing anecdotes from some U.S. doctors of a possible increase in [invasive group A strep] infections among children in the United States” and is “talking with surveillance sites and hospitals in multiple states to learn more.”\n",
            "Group A streptococci are the same bacteria that cause strep throat, as well as skin conditions like scarlet fever (a red rash that feels like sandpaper and can resemble a sunburn) and impetigo (red, itchy sores with yellow scabs).\n",
            "Some people with invasive group A strep may develop those conditions, as well, but in many cases the first sign of invasive strep A is a secondary infection, like pneumonia or flesh-eating disease.\n",
            "“These are cases beyond an ordinary strep throat,” Versalovic said.\n",
            "An invasive infection can trigger the following:\n",
            "Anyone can get invasive strep A, including healthy adults, but people over 65 and those with chronic illnesses are more susceptible. It is not yet clear why hospitals are seeing an uptick in cases among kids in particular. The CDC said it may be related to the rollback of Covid mitigation measures and the surge of respiratory viruses like flu, Covid and RSV.\n",
            "“Oftentimes, kids who develop severe group A strep infections will start out with having a viral respiratory infection,” said Dr. Sam Dominguez, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado and a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n",
            "The U.S. records several million cases of noninvasive group A strep every year, but invasive infections are rare, at around 14,000 to 25,000 cases annually, according to the CDC. Between 1,500 and 2,300 people die of the invasive infections every year.\n",
            "The CDC said it observed decreases in such infections across all age groups during the last two years.\n",
            "In the U.K., the last comparable spike in case numbers was from 2017 to 2018, when 27 children died.\n",
            "At Phoenix Children’s Hospital, case numbers have been rising since the end of October or early November, said Dr. Wassim Ballan, the division chief of infectious diseases. But he said the condition is uncommon compared to RSV or flu.\n",
            "“Even though we’re seeing that this is an uptick in cases, the absolute number itself is not huge,\" Ballan said.\n",
            "Unlike RSV and flu, which tend to pose the most serious threats to very young children, doctors said they're treating kids of all ages for invasive group A strep right now.\n",
            "“We’ve had teenagers, younger kids, kind of the whole range,\" said Dr. Sara Vora, an infectious disease expert at Seattle Children’s.\n",
            "“We had a fairly sick teenager last week who came in with kind of a sepsis presentation and was in the ICU on a ventilator for a few days and then had a fairly rapid recovery and is doing very well,\" Vora added. \"That’s probably the most severe case that I have seen.”\n",
            "But children’s hospitals in several other states — California, New York, Illinois and Minnesota — said they have not detected any increase in invasive group A strep.\n",
            "Parents worried about their children's health should consider seeking emergency medical attention if their children are sleepier or more lethargic than normal, have trouble eating or drinking or are overly dehydrated and not producing urine, Dominguez said.\n",
            "Vora suggested that as a general rule, \"if your kiddo is not acting right, seems to have symptoms that are worse than just an average cold or lasting longer than a couple of days, then it’s worth having them checked out.\"\n",
            "It is important for kids with strep to get care right away so they can start taking antibiotics like penicillin. After 24 hours on antibiotics, a patient usually stops being contagious.\n",

            "\n",
            "It’s barely 9 am. I’m at my favorite cafe, which also happens to be my favorite workspace. The smell of burnt espresso and freshly baked croissants wafts in the air. I type furiously on my laptop, desperate to ride that fleeting window of morning productivity. I’m immersed in my work, and it’s glorious. That’s when I hear the question that always jolts me out of my flow: “Hey man, can you watch my laptop while I use the bathroom?”\n",
            "I glance to my right to see who suddenly intruded on my awareness. I’ve seen him working here before and asking others the same question. He’s wearing a black suit, and the strap of a briefcase hangs over his shoulder. \n",
            "Presumably, if you’re worried about the security of your laptop, you believe a stranger might steal it. But what’s to say the person you ask to watch your table isn’t a thief themselves?\n",
            "He’s looking not at me but at his phone, his eyes darting left to right and back again as he rises from his seat. There’s an intensity to him, and I dig it. I imagine he’s some sort of corporate executive or financial adviser, fielding urgent questions from clients and delegating to his employees and personal assistant. Or maybe he isn’t. It doesn’t matter what his job is. If he’s anything like me or many other people, his laptop is like a fifth limb through which he communicates, learns, works, gets paid and makes arrangements to meet almost any need. \n",
            "I’m sure many of us can relate to this laptop/bathroom dilemma, particularly as fewer professionals are working from traditional secure office spaces. It’s cumbersome to take it with you, but it’s risky to leave it behind. \n",
            "So what is one to do when leaving something valuable in the middle of a public space? Here’s a hint: Don’t ask me or any other stranger to watch it if you don’t have a disability that prevents you from taking your valuables with you. It’s a question of whether the person doing the asking is lazy or entitled (potentially without realizing it) versus actually needing help. In many cases, it’s the former, and that’s where my gripe is. \n",
            "Hear me out — I understand that cafes, especially those that function as coworking spaces, have certain unspoken rules and norms. Among them are don’t hog four chairs if you need only one and don’t chat loudly on a cellphone while those around you are reading. I’m in favor of social norms when they are rational and useful, but I implore cafe society: Please abandon the ones that are irrational and disruptive.  \n",
            "Asking a stranger to watch your laptop while you go to the bathroom when it really isn’t a necessity is both, and it needs to stop. \n",
            "Randomly selecting one person to trust — out of a room full of people you don’t know — is irrational. Presumably, if you’re worried about the security of your laptop, you believe a stranger might steal it. But what’s to say the person you ask to watch your table isn’t a thief themselves? Or, even if they aren’t, who’s to say a thief would be deterred by someone’s occasionally glancing at a table, if they even notice this watchful eye? It’s hardly an improvement from just leaving your laptop unwatched. \n",
            "Some may say it helps foster a sense of community and neighborliness. But does asking a stranger to watch your laptop or any other pricey gadget while you disappear into the restroom really do that?\n",
            "But perhaps you expect more from the stranger who assented to watch your belongings. It’s hard to believe you wouldn’t, because asking someone to watch something of yours turns them from passive to active bystander. So perhaps you expect them to say something to the thief — or even physically intervene — to prevent an act of grand larceny. But think about it. You know nothing of the person you’ve just asked to watch your belongings. What if they have an invisible illness or disability that prevents them from stepping in? Or maybe they’re a parent of young children or a caregiver of some kind, and they think they don’t want to put themselves in a potentially dangerous situation that could leave the people who depend on them alone. Or what if they are on parole and they’re afraid of violating any conditions? Intervention could be a lot to ask of someone. \n",
            "However, if that doesn’t deter you from leaving valuables with a stranger, consider that it could be very disruptive. In my case, it cuts into my productivity, and I’m not alone. Research shows that distractions not only cause people to take longer to complete tasks but also degrade the overall quality of people’s work. Then there’s the fact that the person keeping an eye out can’t get up to order something else, go to the bathroom themselves or leave if they need to for as long as the other person is gone.\n",
            "Still, some may say it helps foster a sense of community and neighborliness. But does asking a stranger to watch your laptop or any other pricey gadget while you disappear into the restroom really do that? It’s not like you’re getting to know the person. When they reappear, you’ll most likely get a “thank you,” and then you both will probably go back to being in your own worlds. The man who asked me to watch his laptop barely looked at me as the words flowed out. If you want to truly build community, there are much better ways to do it. Why not strike up an authentic conversation — you know, with eye contact — with someone who is sitting in your vicinity? \n",
            "So the question is: How can you do your business while letting everyone else mind their own business? Take your laptop with you. Put it in your bag. Place it on the sink. Hold it. If you’re worried about losing your coveted table, leave something inexpensive behind, like a book or a scarf. If you carry a pen and paper, you could even leave a note on the table: “Occupied — be back in five. Thanks!” If you spend a lot of time in cafes, go all out! Buy some place holders that look official. Your belongings are safest when they are with you. Following these tips won’t impose on anyone else, and it makes sense for the world we’re living in.\n",
            "So, with the weight of societal expectations on my shoulders and the hope for a better future in my heart, I answered the man in the suit, “Sure, but you should know that I stole this laptop last week.” He rolled his eyes and took his laptop with him. You’re welcome.\n",

            "As fellow musicians and fans grapple with the uncertain circumstances surrounding his death, they're remembering Rodríguez as a talented artist who helped lift salsa music to new heights.\n",
            "“One of the most beautiful voices my ears have heard and will hear. His unique, tuned and potent timbre made his music immortal,” Puerto Rican merengue singer Elvis Crespo, known for his international hit “Suavemente,” tweeted in Spanish. “My sincere condolences to his family and fans. May our Lalo Rodríguez rest in peace.”\n",
            "According to preliminary information, authorities received a 911 call alerting them about the body on Tuesday. An acquaintance of Rodríguez later arrived at the scene to identify the body. Rodríguez has for years struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol.\n",
            "\"Lalo fought against the vice monster. Unfortunately, drugs rarely lose. Light and progress Lalo,\" salsa music icon Willie Colón, who is also credited for helping popularize the genre, lamented in Spanish on Twitter.\n",
            "The artist, born Ubaldo Rodríguez Santos, started his music career when he was just a teenager. From ages 12 to 15 he was part of the salsa band Tempo Moderno.\n",
            "Rodríguez's undeniable talent as a vocalist earned him the title of “El Canario de Carolina” (The Canary from Carolina) early on this career.\n",
            "In 1973, when he was only 16, Rodríguez sang in \"The Sun of Latin Music,\" a pivotal album from Latin Jazz legend and pianist Eddie Palmieri.\n",
            "The album became the first Latin production to win a Grammy Award. With songs like “Nada de ti” (Nothing of you), “Nunca contigo” (Never with you), “Un día bonito” (A beautiful day) and “Deseo salvaje” (Wild desire), a bolero written by Rodríguez, the album left a mark in the history of Latin music.\n",
            "Palmieri, 85, lamented Rodríguez's death \"with deep sadness.\"\n",
            "\"I don’t need to tell you how much our music and culture has meant to me and to the world,\" Palmieri said in Spanish on Twitter. \"He was a giant in so many ways. We will miss him dearly and treasure his memory.\"\n",
            "Rodríguez eventually went solo. He wrote five songs for his 1980 album \"Simplemente Lalo.\" Some of the most memorable songs from his solo debut album are \"Máximo Chamorro,\" \"Francisco Andante,\" \"Tu no sabes querer\" (You don't know how to love), \"Las mujeres\" (The women) and \"Tristeza encantada\" (Enchanted sadness).\n",
            "\"All those songs became hits.

            "Ferrer, 76, remembered Rodríguez as \"one of the greatest talents I have ever met.\"\n",
            "\"He had it all, he was elegant, had presence, personality and talent,\" Ferrer said.\n",
            "In 1988, Rodríguez established himself as a top exponent of romantic salsa with his hit “Ven devórame otra vez“ from his chart-topping album \"Un Nuevo Despertar\" (A New Awakening) for Rodven Records.\n",
            "\"I made it internationally with that song,\" Rodríguez told Latino entertainment journalist Tony Dandrades in 2007.\n",
            "When asked if another hit such as “Ven devórame otra vez\" could ever exist again, Rodríguez told Dandrades, \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n",
            "\"But, repeat it, no,\" Rodríguez said in Spanish. \"Because times change, it could be even bigger.\"\n",
            "Salsa music enthusiast Juana Peña described Rodríguez as a \"versatile singer, capable of getting into any rhythm and doing it well\" in a tweet.\n",
            "\"He started singing classical salsa and became the first vocalist of the genre to win a Grammy. He later dabbled in romantic salsa and established himself as an idol with this song,\" Peña said in Spanish, in reference to “Ven devórame otra vez.\"\n",

            "China will drop a travel tracing requirement as part of an uncertain exit from its strict “zero-Covid” policies that have elicited widespread dissatisfaction.\n",
            "At midnight on Monday, the smart phone app will cease to function, meaning residents’ travels will not be traced and recorded, potentially reducing the likelihood they will be forced into quarantine for visiting pandemic hot spots.\n",
            "China’s ruling Communist Party allows no independent parties to conduct verification and such apps have been used in past to suppress travel and free speech. It’s part of a package of apps that includes the health code, which has yet to be disabled.\n",
            "The move follows the government’s snap announcement last week that it was ending many of the most draconian measures. That follows three years of lockdowns, travel restrictions and quarantines on those moving between provinces and cities, mandated testing, and requirements that a clean bill of health be shown to access public areas. \n",
            "Last month in Beijing and several other cities, protests over the restrictions grew into calls for leader Xi Jinping and the Communist Party to step down, in a level of public political expression not seen in decades. \n",
            "While met with relief, the relaxation has also sparked concerns about a new wave of infections potentially overwhelming health care resources in some areas.\n",
            "Xi’s government is still officially committed to stopping virus transmission, the last major country to try. But the latest moves suggest the party will tolerate more cases without quarantines or shutting down travel or businesses as it winds down its “zero-Covid” strategy.\n",
            "Facing a surge in Covid-19 cases, China is setting up more intensive care facilities and trying to strengthen hospitals’ ability to deal with severe cases. At the same time, the government reversed course by allowing those with mild symptoms to recuperate at home rather than being sent to field hospitals that have become notorious for overcrowding and poor hygiene.\n",
            "Reports on the Chinese internet, which is tightly controlled by the government, sought to reassure a nervous public, stating that restrictions would continue to be dropped and travel, indoor dining and other economic activity would soon be returning to pre-pandemic conditions. \n",
            "China’s leaders had long praised “zero-Covid” for keeping numbers of cases and deaths much lower than in other nations, but health officials are now saying the most prevalent omicron variety poses much less of a risk.\n",
            "Amid a sharp drop in the amount of testing, China on Monday announced only around 8,500 new cases, bringing the nation’s total to 365,312 — more than double the level since Oct. 1 — with 5,235 deaths. That compares to 1.1 million Covid-19 deaths in the United States.\n",
            "Protests erupted Nov. 25 after 10 people died in a fire in the northwestern city of Urumqi. Many believed Covid-19 restrictions may have impeded rescue efforts. Authorities denied the claims spread online, but demonstrators gave voice to longstanding frustration in cities such as Shanghai that have endured severe lockdowns. \n",
            "The party responded with a massive show of force and an unknown number of people were arrested at the protests or in the days following.\n",
            "Amid the unpredictable messaging from Beijing, experts warn there still is a chance the ruling party might reverse course and reimpose restrictions if a large-scale outbreak ensues.\n",
            "Last week’s announcement allowed considerable room for local governments to assign their own regulations. Most restaurants in Beijing, for example, still require a negative test result obtained over the previous 48 hours and rules are even stricter for government offices. \n",
            "The uncertainty and apparent growing number of cases — despite the lack of government data — have forced the cancellation of events from foreign embassy holiday parties to next spring’s Formula One Chinese Grand Prix car race in Shanghai.\n",
            "Meanwhile, pharmacies in Hong Kong have reported a run on Panadol and other cold, flu and headache medications by customers supplying relatives in mainland China, according to Lam Wai-man, chairman of the pharmacy trade association in the semi-autonomous southern Chinese city, which has already lifted most of its Covid-19 restrictions.\n",
            "“Everyone on the mainland wants to buy some pills to have in reserve at home,” Lam said.\n",
            "Alan Cheung, the owner of the Sands Medicine Shop in the Wan Chai district, said he was receiving around 10 inquiries about flu medication from mainland residents every day. “Normally, no one would ask me about this kind of product normally,” Cheung said.\n",

            "\n",
            "The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged seven social media influencers with securities fraud, saying Wednesday that they were part of a $100 million scheme to use social media platforms Twitter and Discord, as well as podcasts, to manipulate the price of certain stocks.\n",
            "Though the influencers are not household names, they had accrued more than 2 million followers across various social media platforms, where they routinely posted photos of their wealth including of exotic sports cars.\n",
            "The influencers charged include “PJ Matlock,” whose real name is Perry Matlock. On Wednesday, he had deactivated his Twitter account, which had more than 340,000 followers.\n",
            "One person, Daniel Knight, who goes by the online handle “DipDeity,” was charged with “aiding and abetting the alleged scheme” after co-hosting a podcast that promoted the other defendants, the SEC said.\n",
            "Other defendants include Edward Constantin, who went by the online handle “MrZackMorris”; Thomas Cooperman, who goes by “ohheytommy”; Gary Deel, who goes by “Mystic Mac” or “notoriousalerts”; Mitchell Hennessey, who goes by “Hugh Henne”; Stefan Hrvatin, who goes by “LadeBackk”; and John Rybarcyzk, who goes by “The Stock Sniper” or “Ultra_Calls.”\n",
            "Each of them have at least 100,000 Twitter followers, as well as significant followings on other platforms.\n",
            "They did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",
            "The SEC also said criminal charges have been filed by the Justice Department's Fraud Section and the U.S. attorney’s office for Southern Texas.\n",
            "Discord is a private chatroom and messaging platform that is popular with gaming influencers and, more recently, financial influencers. One Discord chat in particular, Atlas Trading, which as of Wednesday morning had more than 233,000 members, allegedly served as a primary forum for the scheme. According to the SEC, seven of the defendants promoted stocks to their hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers and in stock trading rooms on Discord since at least January 2020.\n",
            "After purchasing the stocks and encouraging their followers to do the same, the defendants “regularly sold their shares without ever having disclosed their plans to dump the securities while they were promoting them,” the SEC said in a news release.\n",
            "The SEC said in a complaint filed Tuesday that recordings of some of the defendants showed them discussing their alleged scheme over Discord voice chats, including one from March 1, 2021, between Knight and Cooperman.\n",
            "“We’re robbing f------ idiots of their money,” Knight allegedly said.\n",
            "The alleged form of fraud is commonly referred to as a “pump and dump” scheme, a phrase that was used in the grand jury indictment filed Dec. 7.\n",
            "According to the SEC, the scheme occurred in three phases: The group would identify a stock and organize purchases at a lower price prior to the alleged manipulation. They would then promote the stock to their followers and inflate the share price, announcing price targets and teasing upcoming news about the company. They would then sell their shares into the demand generated by their hyping, creating a profit. To cover up their scheme, they would delete old tweets and Discord chats, then lie to their followers about why particular stock picks were followed by price declines, thus obscuring their roles in having generated losses for their followers, the SEC complaint alleged.\n",
            "“None of the Primary Defendants disclosed that they were either planning to sell, or were actively selling, a Selected Stock while recommending that their followers buy it,” the SEC’s complaint stated. “Nor did any of the Primary Defendants disclose that they were coordinating with each other to manipulate the price and volume of trading in the stocks they were promoting.”\n",
            "The SEC also alleged the group spread “false or misleading news” about the companies through their various social media accounts and on podcasts, and that on some occasions they lied about losing money to generate trust among their followers, “when in reality they had profited handsomely.”\n",
            "“Indeed, in private chats and surreptitiously recorded conversations, they bragged and laughed about making profits at the expense of their followers,” the SEC stated.\n",
            "The allegations come after online stock speculation has exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to a combination of low-cost trading apps and the emergence of so-called meme stocks, such as GameStop, AMC, and Bed Bath and Beyond, which saw price surges generated in part by speculation in online forums like Reddit — though notably, Reddit is not mentioned in the SEC complaint. \n",
            "Unlike those big-name companies, the SEC charged the defendants with manipulating so-called small-cap firms — ones with much lower valuations, often no more than a few million dollars or less — and penny stocks. Those stocks are often ripe for manipulation because they receive less attention and have lower trading volumes.\n",
            "CORRECTION (Dec. 14, 2022, 11:51 a.m. ET): The headline and text of a previous version of this article misstated how many people were charged with securities fraud. It is seven people, not eight.\n",

            "\n",
            "HARRISBURG, Pa. — Five weeks after Election Day, winning candidates in Pennsylvania from governor to Congress are waiting for their victories to become official.\n",
            "An effort that appears to be at least partially coordinated among conservatives has inundated counties with ballot recount requests even though no races are close enough to require a recount and there has been no evidence of any potential problems.\n",
            "The attempt to delay certification could foreshadow a potential strategy for the 2024 presidential election, if the results don’t go the way disaffected voters want in one of the nation’s most closely contested states.\n",
            "Recounts have been sought in 172 voting precincts across 40% of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. That led to nine counties missing their Nov. 29 certification deadline, though all but one has since certified.\n",
            "The Pennsylvania Department of State, in a response to The Associated Press on Wednesday, gave no date for certifying the results statewide but said it planned to comply with a request from the clerk of the U.S. House to send certification documents to Congress by mid-December. Wednesday was Dec. 14.\n",
            "Chris Deluzio, a Pittsburgh Democrat elected in November to the U.S. House, said the delay has had only a minor effect on him so far. Without his win being official, however, the congressman-elect doesn’t get to send out mail at no charge, as other members of Congress do, for example.\n",
            "“I think if people are able to come to the courts and delay certification results without any real evidence, that’s a problem, and I see some abuse of that process here,” Deluzio said.\n",
            "Judges authorized at least 19 precinct recounts in six counties. Those requesting the recounts said they wanted to check the accuracy of the state’s election equipment and processes, echoing the conspiracy claims of voting machine manipulation for which there is no evidence.\n",
            "Brittany Crampsie, a political consultant involved with Democratic campaigns in Pennsylvania, said she expects the recount tactic to continue “as long as Donald Trump and his acolytes remain prevalent in the Republican Party.”\n",
            "“In a lot of these cases, it’s entirely political and it’s a waste of taxpayer funds,” Crampsie said.\n",
            "Rural county commissions in Arizona and New Mexico delayed or threatened to delay certification of primary or general elections results this year, in each case without evidence that anything was amiss in the vote counting.\n",
            "An AP survey of the Pennsylvania precinct recounts found the recount challenges altered vote tallies barely or not at all. The absence of any problems led one county judge to urge state legislators to amend Pennsylvania’s recount law.\n",
            "Westmoreland Common Pleas Judge Harry Smail Jr., in a footnote to orders granting recounts, said such demands ought to be accompanied by specific claims of error or fraud.\n",
            "“A sustained failure to address this deficiency will continue to burden the courts, elections bureaus, elections boards, county executive branches and the voting public by allowing manufactured challenges without a scintilla of evidentiary support to any and possibly all election certification processes in future elections,” Smail wrote.\n",
            "Rep. Leanne Krueger, who leads the state House Democratic Campaign Committee, said those who deny the results of the 2020 presidential election have been trying to stop election certification for several years.\n",
            "“These petitions are unsuccessful largely because they’re not grounded,” Krueger said. “And every time there’s a request for the county board of elections to do something like this, they are forcing the spending of taxpayer money on elections that have already been decided.”\n",
            "By state law, recounts must be done for all election districts where ballots were cast in a given race. For statewide contests, that would mean all precincts in a county. There is an exception to permit more narrow recounts if the petitioners claim “a particular act of fraud or error occurred” and they provide some evidence to support that.\n",
            "A lack of any evidence or particular claim was the grounds cited by many of the judges who rejected recount petitions.\n",
            "At least two of the recount requests were supported by local Republican Party groups. It’s unclear whether the wider request effort also is linked to Audit the Vote PA, a group founded in early 2021 out of the false belief that something was wrong with the 2020 presidential results in Pennsylvania, where Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Audit the Vote PA founder Karen Taylor filed a recount petition in Westmoreland County.\n",
            "The group’s co-founder, Toni Shuppe, said during a Nov. 28 question-and-answer session on the social media platform Rumble that people had found a way to submit petitions, but she didn’t attribute the effort to her organization.\n",
            "“It’s our sacred vote, and this movement isn’t going away and people aren’t going to shut up,” Shuppe said in the online forum, urging that ballots be counted by hand.\n",
            "The requests have generally sought hand counts in the races for governor and U.S. Senate, but some also have asked to double-check the vote totals for U.S. House and for state representative. Many used a form letter with blank spaces to fill in the precinct and county.\n",
            "The AP precinct survey did not turn up any recount requests driven by candidates who lost close contests.\n",
            "Several petitioners were turned down because they worked as election officials on Nov. 8 and certified the results as accurate. Others were rejected for not living in the precinct for which a recount was requested or for not paying a required $50 bond.\n",
            "Some counties targeted for recounts had already sent their totals in to the Department of State before being notified of the legal actions, but others had not yet certified or had certified only partial results.\n",
            "Lycoming County elections chief Forrest Lehman said defending a single recount petition required making copies of poll books and collecting a variety of records.\n",
            "“We felt compelled to be ready for anything,” Lehman said. “That certainly took hours of my time and then hours of our solicitor’s time.”\n",

            "Their plan was to focus on Black female college athletes, securing more exposure and endorsement deals following the NCAA’s new name, image and likeness, or NIL, policy that allows players to be compensated.\n",
            "“Black female athletes are some of the most talented human beings on this planet,” Omogun-Broadnax said. “Yet, they are often overlooked for partnership opportunities that would help grow and advance their brands and careers.”\n",
            "Before the NIL ruling in 2021, sports programs generated billions of dollars, but the athletes who competed were not able to receive payment.\n",
            "School and athletic programs were enriched, but the players, many from families with financial challenges, received nothing or faced disqualification if they brokered a deal. Now, top college athletes have the opportunity to profit for the first time in NCAA history. \n",
            "With their newly launched company, Omogun-Broadnax and Davis hoped to bring their personal touch, attention and passion to their clients. Omogun-Broadnax, a former criminal defense lawyer, even quit her most recent job as a litigator to lead the sports component of the company, while Davis, a personal injury lawyer, heads up the entertainment arm of Solace, based in Northern Virginia.\n",
            "Omogun-Broadnax said she could understand the plight of many struggling athletes who love the sport but are financially stressed. In high school, she used sports as an escape from some of the tough circumstances she faced while growing up in Memphis, Tennessee. The daughter of a hardworking, single-mother African immigrant, Omogun-Broadnax spent part of her time in an extended stay hotel across the street from her middle school. When she went to college, things weren’t much better. She found joy in being a cross-country runner at Clark Atlanta University, but often struggled to find money for food.\n",
            "“That experience informed my passion for making sure Black women athletes are included in the NIL and represented with care,” Omogun-Broadnax said. “I can’t even begin to describe how game-changing NIL would have been for me. There are some people who think these athletes are living good, that boosters are taking care of them. But the average athlete day to day is definitely struggling. …That’s why I am such a proponent of supporting these Black female athletes — they are the last ones to be considered.”\n",
            "Solace’s talent roster is made up of five carefully selected clients. While adding more could help grow the business financially, the partners say they are discerning about who they take on and how large the agency grows. “We are intent on building out only to a point,” Omogun-Broadnax said. “We are hands-on. When our clients need us, they will get us and not staff members.”\n",
            "Opendorse, an NIL technology company and marketplace, found 12.6% of NIL compensation went to women’s basketball players, CNBC reported. Data from On3 NIL, another NIL tracking company, indicates that eight of the top 10 earners among female athletes are white.\n",
            "“One of my greatest missions is to use my skills, knowledge and creativity to attract opportunities for our clients that will transcend the limitations created by the industry’s status quo,” Omogun-Broadnax said.\n",
            "There are other Black women who work as sports agents, but their clients are mostly professional male athletes. Nicole Lynn of Houston has established herself by representing NFL players, including MVP candidate Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles. In Atlanta, Rashida Gayle became an agent at 27 and has a client list that includes NFL and Major League Soccer players.\n",
            "Solace’s focus on Black female athletes gives the agency a rare niche. Davis said that niche sets them apart and Omogun-Broadnax “is the perfect person to lead in this space because of her personal experience.”\n",
            "“She has been a student-athlete, and she understands the plight of the African American woman in the sports industry,” Davis said. “She’s scrappy. She’s a fighter, a hard worker, a professional. She makes sure she gets into the weeds of the details of every contract. And she always looks at things from an African American point of view and as an opportunity to grow as a community.”\n",
            "A concern about NIL is the potential for the exploitation of young Black athletes, especially high schoolers seeking to capitalize on their talent before making the professional ranks. Last year, the Supreme Court forced the NCAA to abandon its educational-related “no pay” policies for athletes. But the guidelines are few.\n",
            "“Which makes trust a real factor,” Davis said.\n",
            "Being Black in an industry where the predominant potential clients are Black can be advantageous. “It’s the language that we share with one another and the shared experiences,” he said. “So when we speak with clients, and they look like us, it’s easier to communicate contract negotiations, or just a baseline understanding of information. And they feel comfortable with us because of the shared and sometimes drastic experiences that both sides have shared. There’s value in that.”\n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "U.S. intelligence agencies began warning that Covid-19 could become a pandemic just weeks after the coronavirus was first reported in China, but they missed an opportunity to better understand its spread because they didn’t quickly begin spying on Chinese health officials who were hiding what they knew, says a newly declassified report by the House Intelligence Committee.\n",
            "The report partly vindicates the CIA and other U.S. spy agencies, noting that they raised the specter of a pandemic well before the World Health Organization declared one on March 11, 2020. And it adds to the body of evidence showing that then-President Donald Trump misled the public about what he was hearing from advisers about the seriousness of the virus. The intelligence warnings summarized in the report debunk Trump’s contention that intelligence officials described the virus “in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.”\n",
            "But the report, authored by staff members for the committee's Democratic majority, also says U.S. intelligence agencies have largely failed to fix their shortcomings in public health intelligence and are therefore not adequately prepared for the next pandemic. That is in part, investigators found, because many intelligence officers don’t see biological threats as a top-tier national security issue, even after more than a million people died from Covid in the U.S.\n",
            "“We would be moving heaven and earth if we lost a million people as a result of some terrorist incident,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the frequent Trump critic who chairs the Intelligence Committee, said in an interview.\n",
            "Schiff said the intelligence community has failed to create “the culture … to recognize a biothreat as a hard threat that could kill massive numbers of our citizens the way we view terrorism and other threats,” adding, “And so that’s a cultural change that needs to take place.”\n",
            "The report didn’t delve deeply into the effort by the intelligence community to examine the question of whether Covid began to infect humans through animal transmission or a lab leak in China.\n",
            "It said the current U.S. government view on that hasn’t changed since a declassified summary was released in August 2021, revealing that one U.S. intelligence agency assesses with moderate confidence that the virus infected humans after a lab-associated incident, while four others assess with low confidence that the virus emerged naturally.\n",
            "Schiff said the intelligence community’s “failure to pivot” to collecting Covid-related intelligence from China made it less likely that evidence supporting a lab leak, if that is in fact what happened, will be uncovered.\n",
            "“I wouldn’t characterize it as an intelligence failure, but they were very slow to pivot and use their unique assets to glean insights that were not in the public record,” Schiff said. “And that, to me, is the most fundamental missed opportunity.”\n",
            "A separate report issued Wednesday evening by the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee accused intelligence agencies of “misleading” omissions in their public assessment of Covid origins, adding that the Republicans have “reason to believe that the [intelligence community] downplayed the possibility that SARS-CoV2 was connected to China’s bioweapons program based in part on input from outside experts.”\n",
            "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on either report.\n",
            "The Democrats' report, which is replete with blacked-out sections after a declassification review by ODNI, looks closely at exactly when and how the intelligence community first learned about the virus, what warnings were given to the Trump White House and what steps investigators believe agencies should take to be better prepared for future pandemics. The House investigators didn’t have access to presidential briefing documents, but they said they were able to piece together from documents and interviews what information most likely made it to Trump’s intelligence briefing.\n",
            "Investigators said they were “unable to corroborate” reports by NBC News and ABC News that U.S. spies collected raw intelligence in November indicating a health crisis in Wuhan, China.\n",
            "The report says the first intelligence report mentioning the virus that would become known as coronavirus or Covid-19 came on the day of the first media report about it.\n",
            "On Dec. 31, 2019, an analyst at the National Center for Medical Intelligence, a component of the Defense Intelligence Agency, noticed a report on a public health listserv run by the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, known as ProMED, about an unexplained pneumonia that Chinese officials were seeing in Wuhan.\n",
            "The analyst, identified as Mark, flagged the notice in a report titled “Note: Possible Pandemic Warning Update” and put it in a database that is used by U.S. military commanders around the world.\n",
            "“Mark had … flagged the disease as an event that warranted close scrutiny,” the House report said.\n",
            "The same day, The Associated Press published a story about the ProMED notice, which came to the attention of White House officials, the House report says. Over the next few days and weeks, National Security Council officials asked the intelligence agencies to figure out what the Chinese government was hiding and whether there was, in fact, human-to-human transmission of the virus, the report says. But as an official told investigators, intelligence agencies “weren’t giving us anything.” \n",
            "U.S. spy agencies have an array of satellites that can photograph unusual activity around hospitals and vast capabilities to intercept phone calls and emails among Chinese government officials. They can also use supercomputers to glean insights from vast troves of social media and other “open source” intelligence. But none of those capabilities were brought to bear in a way that produced fruitful insights to help U.S. officials to understand what was happening with Covid in China, the House report concludes.\n",
            "The report quotes an intelligence agency briefer telling a White House official that “we’re just not structured” to provide information about the emerging pandemic.\n",
            "Nonetheless, on Jan. 24, 2020, the National Center for Medical Intelligence issued an intelligence report saying that “since mid-December, a novel coronavirus has emerged in China, which has a roughly even chance of becoming a global pandemic during the next four months.”\n",
            "The notion that Trump failed to convey to the public what he knew about the dangers of the coronavirus isn’t knew. Trump acknowledged downplaying the threat in taped interviews with Bob Woodward for his book “Rage.”\n",
            "“I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down because I don’t want to create a panic,” Trump said in a March 19, 2020, call with Woodward.\n",
            "Woodward reported that national security adviser Robert O’Brien told Trump on Jan. 28, 2020, that “this will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency.”\n",
            "The House report says that by the end of January, “despite the difficulties in getting clandestine collection, intelligence community analysts had sounded the alarm,” adding, “Items on the coronavirus had probably appeared several times in the (President’s Daily Brief), and had been briefed multiple times to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.”\n",
            "Trump, at a Michigan campaign rally on Jan. 30, painted a much different picture.\n",
            "“We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully. But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us — that I can assure you.”\n",
            "Schiff said: “That policy failure wasn’t just a failure to warn, but all the politicization of mask-wearing, the attacks on science and scientists like [Dr. Anthony] Fauci, which go on to this day. All of that, I think, cost lives and undermines our ability to deal with the next one.”\n",
            "The report says, “The divergence between the Intelligence Community’s late January conclusions and the former president’s rhetoric is striking.”\n",
            "A Trump spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n",
            "Committee investigators said National Intelligence Director Avril Haines has made limited progress in reorienting agencies so they are better positioned to collect intelligence about the next emerging pandemic. But they say much more needs to be done.\n",
            "The intelligence community remains “well positioned to use public health information” and other public information but “poorly positioned to collect uniquely valuable intelligence in support of a crisis response,” the report says.\n",

            "But her ability to pay it off now rests in the hands of the Supreme Court.\n",
            "More than 40 million borrowers like Morales-Bartlett were eligible to cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt under President Joe Biden’s one-time student loan forgiveness plan.\n",
            "With a remaining balance of $19,000, the former University of California, Santa Barbara, student applied to the program as soon as it opened, with high hopes. Morales-Bartlett received an email from the U.S. Department of Education two weeks ago saying her application had been approved.\n",
            "But instead, her debt and that of roughly 16 million applicants who were also approved may never be forgiven if the Supreme Court sides with lower courts in Republican-led states that blocked the program. A ruling is expected next year.\n",
            "NBC News spoke to a dozen student loan forgiveness applicants nationwide, ages 24 to 60, who had hoped for relief from their crippling debt — which has left some struggling to afford medical expenses and basic necessities and others unable to buy a home or start a family.\n",
            "“It’s disheartening,” said Morales-Bartlett, 46, a former teacher from California who has been paying off her $89,000 in student loan debt the last thirty years and is currently dealing with health-related issues. “We’ve done the right things this whole time, and we are being punished for it.”\n",
            "The Biden administration has since closed the application process until the court decides the program's fate sometime next year.\n",
            "Meanwhile, the pandemic-era federal student loan repayment pause has been extended while the government awaits the court’s decision.\n",
            "The onerous cost of higher education is a persistent challenge as communities continue to encourage college completion, especially for groups such as Latinos who lag in the number of adults with college degrees, with recent gains set back by the pandemic.\n",
            "Going to college is credited with greater opportunities for socioeconomic mobility.\n",
            "For Daisy Pérez, 49, earning a college degree and becoming a registered nurse helped her family get out of poverty and “at least make ends meet,” her daughter Cristher Estrada-Pérez said.\n",
            "Estrada-Pérez said her mother may never be able to pay off the $90,000 in student debt, which includes a Parent Plus loan for Estrada-Perez’s college tuition.\n",
            "“She’s never going to be able to own a home and earn enough to retire,” Estrada-Pérez, 32, said.\n",
            "The crisis has left parents and their adult children grappling with how to pay off student debt, which has been steadily rising in the U.S. for more than a decade, reaching $1.745 trillion this year. The average federal student loan debt nears $30,000.\n",
            "Estrada-Pérez, who is also the executive director of the Student Loan Fund in Connecticut, which helps predominantly Black and Latino borrowers navigate their debt, is paying off $80,000 for her student loans.\n",
            "As Federal Pell Grant recipients, Estrada-Pérez and her mother stand to get $20,000 in debt forgiveness if the Supreme Court rules to keep Biden’s program. But still, that barely covers the interest rates their loans have accumulated over the years, she said.\n",
            "Estrada-Pérez, who majored in history at St. Joseph's University in West Hartford, had aspired to become a lawyer, but “I couldn’t think about what my debt would look like if I even attempted to go to law school.”\n",
            "Lisa Brown, 60, of North Carolina remembers paying for college at the University of Southern Maine with her parent’s help about four decades ago, when tuition was about $3,000 a year. Now, attending a four-year university can cost $25,000 to $55,000 a year on average.\n",
            "After earning a bachelor’s in psychology, Brown returned to school in an attempt to improve her job prospects. She graduated from Walden University in 2002 with a master's in forensic psychology.\n",
            "This time around she ended up with $40,000 in student loan debt, which has almost doubled to about $70,000 over the past decade because of compounded interest. Brown also has a $17,000 Parent Plus loan — federal loans that parents of dependent undergraduate students can use — from when her 31-year-old son was studying sound engineering at an art institute in Boston.\n",
            "At Brown's age, medical bills are also starting to pile up, she said. Even with insurance, she is still paying a $2,600 balance from an operation she had two years ago.\n",
            "“I’m going to struggle until the day I die with this crappy debt,” said Brown, who is looking for work. “If they’re going to make us continue to pay ... then don’t make getting jobs harder for older people.” If approved, Brown could receive up to $10,000 in loan forgiveness under Biden’s program.\n",
            "Brown’s son still has about $50,000 in student debt despite being one of the thousands of North Carolinians who received some student loan relief as part of a multistate settlement with Navient, one of the nation’s largest student loan servicers, over allegations of unfair and deceptive student loan servicing and predatory lending practices, according to North Carolina's Attorney General Josh Stein's office. He also applied to the currently blocked student loan forgiveness program and is waiting to hear back.\n",
            "The unresolved student debt crisis has many borrowers questioning whether the ends justify the means. Esther Jean-Marie is one of them.\n",
            "The 30-year-old of Haitian descent graduated from the University of Hartford in 2015 and went on to complete a master's in nonprofit management and philanthropy to increase her chances of making a livable wage and \"set myself up for success,\" she said.\n",
            "After working multiple jobs to pay for college, Jean-Marie achieved her dream of doing nonprofit work, but still ended up with $88,000 in student debt.\n",
            "First-generation college graduates such as Jean-Marie, Estrada-Pérez and Morales-Bartlett tend to have lower incomes and accumulate less wealth, on average, compared to those with a parent who has a bachelor’s or higher degree, complicating their ability to repay loans, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center analysis.\n",
            "Alexis V. said she survived an act of sexual violence while studying business administration at the University of Southern California. She ended up taking a health leave and graduated in December 2013, a semester later than expected.\n",
            "\"It cost me thousands of dollars just because I needed time to process the trauma of sexual assault,\" Alexis, who now has $55,000 in student debt, said.\n",
            "According to a survey on sexual violence and student debt from the Sexual Violence Prevention Association, her experience is not unique. Experiencing sexual violence often leads to higher student loans and increased difficulty repaying the debt, founder and CEO Omny Miranda Martone said.\n",
            "Alexis has been approved to receive $10,000 in loan forgiveness under Biden's program. While it's still significantly less than what she had hoped, as the first in her Filipino family to go to college, \"I’d be better able to support my parents. My dad could hopefully be less stressed about retiring.\"\n",
            "The current pause on student debt repayment due to the pandemic has helped. It made it easier for Alexis to afford living on her own. For Martone (who uses they/them pronouns), not having the financial strain of repayment allowed them to pursue their goal of starting an organization to prevent sexual violence.\n",
            "It also helped Jean-Marie and Nick Marcil of Pennsylvania afford long overdue fixes to their cars.\n",
            "Marcil, 24, would get about half of his roughly $18,000 in student debt forgiven if the Biden federal loan forgiveness program is allowed to go into effect. He earned a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in education from West Chester University. Still living with his parents, he was hoping to be one step closer to financial freedom and to being on his own.\n",
            "Since the program was put on hold, borrowers spoke of feeling their hopes fade that the Biden administration would be able to prevent the states from blocking the measure.\n",
            "\"There is compounded distrust from the public that this can even work,\" Brianna Dunlap, who has a $123,000 student debt, said. She had applied for another student debt cancellation program but a change in the requirements precluded her from getting relief. Still, the 32-year-old from Connecticut reluctantly applied for the program and is waiting to hear back.\n",
            "Regardless of whether she qualifies, Dunlap would still be left with a six-figure debt. \"How could I plan on having kids and paying for their future when my own student debt future is completely unknown?\" Dunlap said, explaining why she and her husband are considering not having kids.\n",
            "For Illinois resident Megan Stemm-Wade, the payments she has made toward her $39,000 student debt since finishing school in 2014 have barely lowered her balance, since most of it goes toward interest. \"It feels like it'll never go away,\" she said. Her hope is that the student debt program will finally help her take a meaningful step forward.\n",
            "Thomas Gokey, a policy director at the Debt Collective, a membership-based union for debtors, said the secretary of Education has authority to \"cancel student debt in the event of an emergency\" under the HEROES Act of 2003 and \"to compromise and settle student loans for any reason\" under the Higher Education Act of 1965, which in part regulates how the secretary may administer existing loan forgiveness programs.\n",
            "The Biden administration did use the HEROES Act, but by putting in place an application process, Gokey said, it opened the door for Republicans to challenge the program in court. The application was made to exclude a small number of student loan borrowers (about 3%) who earn over $125,000 from receiving relief during the first two years of the pandemic, Gokey said.\n",
            "\"But the entire program is now at risk,\" said Gokey, who applied to the program hoping it would forgive a fourth of his student debt.\n",
            "In response to a query from NBC News about the administration's next steps as the program remains on hold, the Department of Education pointed to previous statements by Education Secretary Miguel Cardona announcing the extension of the student loan repayment pause. Last week, the White House said in a statement the loan forgiveness program is \"legal, supported by careful analysis from administration lawyers,\" and stated that Biden \"will keep fighting against efforts to rob middle class families of the relief they need and deserve.\"\n",
            "Carol Deas-Lopez, 60, a clinical psychologist from California, said she began doing advocacy with the Debt Collective as a way to cope with \"the depression and anxiety that goes along with financial stressors like these, which have the capability of rendering me or anyone else homeless or seriously wipe us out financially.\"\n",
            "Deas-Lopez qualified for the Biden program's maximum of $20,000 in federal loan forgiveness. But with over $300,000 in debt, she sometimes wakes up in the middle of night \"just kind of in terror about the whole thing,\" she said.\n",
            "If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the program, close to 20 million people would have their debt fully canceled, according to the Biden administration.\n",
            "“That's a big deal,” said Estrada-Pérez. “It’s about economic justice. We’re borrowers who are not just struggling with student debt payments, we’re struggling with inflation, cost of living.”\n",
            "Morales-Bartlett would be one of those 20 million people who would be debt-free through Biden's program. It would lift a huge weight off her shoulders after having to quit her job due to health reasons — and already using up her retirement savings.\n",
            "\"I hope,\" Morales-Bartlett said, \"that the court finds a way to not stand in the way of this anymore.\"\n",

            "Former House Speaker John Boehner paid a tearful tribute to Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday at the unveiling of her official portrait in the U.S. Capitol.\n",
            "Boehner, R-Ohio, who had a reputation for frequently tearing up when he was speaker, offered warm words for Pelosi, D-Calif., the outgoing speaker, who has often been demonized by GOP lawmakers.\n",
            "\"You’ve been incredibly effective as the leader of your caucus. The younger generation today has a saying: 'Game recognizes game.' The fact of the matter is no other speaker of the House in the modern era — Republican or Democrat — has wielded the gavel with such authority or with such consistent results,\" Boehner said, calling Pelosi \"one tough cookie.\"\n",
            "\"My girls told me, 'Tell the speaker how much we admire her,'\" Boehner said, choking back tears as he spoke. \"As if you couldn't tell, my girls are Democrats,\" he said to laughs at the ceremony in the Capitol.\n",
            "Pelosi, who in 2007 became the first female speaker of the House, had joked about Boehner’s penchant for tears when she spoke at his portrait ceremony in 2019.\n",
            "“I was just trying to think of occasions when I saw John crying. And then I was thinking of occasions when I didn’t see John crying,” she quipped before she praised him as a “formidable spokesman for his party and for his cause” and someone who “sought common ground when he could and held his ground when he could not.”\n",
            "Pelosi said Wednesday that she was \"honored\" by his presence and joked, “I would have been a little disappointed if he did not get emotional.”\n",
            "Boehner's and Pelosi's portraits were painted by the same artist, Ronald Sherr, who Boehner said died just a week ago.\n",
            "Others at Wednesday’s event included Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Reps. Zoe Lofgren and Lucille Roybal-Allard, both D-Calif. Former President Barack Obama sent a video message.\n",
            "Pelosi was accompanied Wednesday by family members, including her husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attacked in their home in October by a man who authorities allege said he was searching for the speaker. Pelosi thanked her husband for being her “loving partner of life, my constant, constant pillar of support.”\n",
            "Pelosi announced last month that she was stepping down from her leadership post after Republicans won the majority in the November midterm elections. She will be succeeded by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the first Black lawmaker to lead a congressional caucus.\n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "WASHINGTON — Democrats are grappling with how to handle a potential re-election bid by newly minted independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in 2024, fearing that a three-way battle could split their voters and throw the race to Republicans in Arizona.\n",
            "Democratic leaders won't say whether they expect to grant her the protections and financing of an incumbent.\n",
            "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer declined to engage with questions about whether the party would support her in 2024 or whether he’d treat Sinema like any Democrat seeking re-election, should she ask for the party's backing.\n",
            "“Look, right now I’m focused on the lame duck,” he said Wednesday in an interview on Capitol Hill.\n",
            "A spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which protects incumbents, said it had no comment.\n",
            "Sinema’s exit presents a thorny dilemma for Democrats. They can't throw her overboard because her vote is key to the party's 51-seat Senate majority for the next two years — they might need her vote to approve nominations or must-pass bills. But with the Arizona state party determined to back a Democrat in the race, and multiple prospects gearing up to run, national Democrats will face pressure to support a nominee of their own.\n",
            "The situation is \"slightly unique,\" said a Democratic strategist working on Senate races, who said the party is waiting to “see how things play out on her end” in terms of announcing whether or not she runs. “There are multiple factors involved, including the national party apparatus, the state party dynamics,\" this person said.\n",
            "The strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about a complex situation, said Arizona is a must-win for the party to keep its majority in a difficult 2024 cycle. If Sinema proves she's best-positioned to defeat Republicans, it may nudge some national Democrats to back her, said the source, while noting that others, like Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., appear to be gearing up to run.\n",
            "\"Once she announces whether she’s running for re-election or whether she will, frankly, cash out, then folks will get a better sense,\" the Democratic strategist said. \"It’s challenging.\"\n",
            "Sinema's office wouldn't say whether she'll run for re-election, with a spokesperson insisting she’s not focused on campaign politics. Her office added that she didn't attend Democratic caucus meetings even when she was a member of the party and will continue to avoid them.\n",
            "Many Democratic senators sidestepped the question this week.\n",
            "Asked how the DSCC should handle a possible Sinema 2024 run, Sinema's Arizona colleague, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, “I haven’t given that any thought.\"\n",
            "Kelly, who was re-elected in November by a 5-point margin, said he has a “very good relationship” with Sinema but wouldn’t say if he wants her to run again. “I’ve worked very closely with her to the benefit of the people of Arizona and this country,\" Kelly said.\n",
            "Further complicating matters is that Democrats don’t yet have a DSCC chair, with Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., indicating that he will relinquish the position for the 2024 cycle. Democrats face a challenging map in two years, defending three seats in GOP-leaning states and another five in closely divided states.\n",
            "Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., also steered clear.\n",
            "“I’m trying to stay out of Arizona politics,” he said.\n",
            "Schumer said he has granted Sinema’s request to preserve her committee assignments through the Democratic Party, meaning the 51-49 partisan organization of the chamber won’t change.\n",
            "“She’s always been an independent. This just commemorates it,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, who wouldn’t comment on her possible 2024 bid when asked about it during a Senate vote, adding, “I don’t talk about elections in the building.”\n",
            "Many Democrats have praised Sinema’s legislative work after she spent two years at the center of several bipartisan deals that became law, from the infrastructure package to a measure to tighten up gun laws and background check requirements.\n",
            "“Her change in partisanship to independent reflects very much her own leadership style and she’s a very independent member of our caucus,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., who also faces re-election in 2024. She wouldn’t say if Democrats should back her but said her working relationship with Sinema won’t change.\n",
            "Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., a former DSCC chair, said: “That’s a call for somebody else.”\n",
            "“I got to thinking about the question especially as it applies to Angus King. Angus King, we’ve never had a Democrat run against him,” he said, referring to the two-term independent senator from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and is up for re-election in 2024.\n",
            "Some Republicans believe a three-way contest would help the GOP candidate win, given that Sinema votes more with Democrats and is ideologically closer to her former party.\n",
            "“If she decides to run, that could well split the Democratic vote and help the Republicans,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a former chair of his party’s Senate campaign arm.\n",
            "Prior to her party switch, Sinema had stronger relationships with Republican senators than just about any Democrat.\n",
            "“She and I talk all the time. She has a lot of friends on our side of the aisle, including me,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. “And I think she’s decided she’s genuinely an independent, and is charting her own course.”\n",
            "Gallego, a favorite of many progressives who has long been considering a Senate run in 2024, argued that Sinema running as an independent wouldn’t hurt him or another Democratic candidate.\n",
            "“A candidate as unpopular as Kyrsten running only helps the Democrat win,” he said, arguing that Sinema only changed parties because she shows she would lose in a Democratic primary. “So I’m very excited for her to stay in the race.”\n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "Two survivors of the Nov. 19 attack on a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, told members of Congress on Wednesday that they believe the shooting was the result of escalating anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. \n",
            "They testified during the House Oversight Committee’s hearing on “The Rise of Anti-LGBTQI+ Extremism and Violence in the United States,” which occurred amid a nationwide wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation and an increase in hate crimes targeting LGBTQ people in major cities. \n",
            "The committee heard from Michael Anderson and James Slaugh, two survivors of the shooting at Club Q, which left five people dead and 17 others injured after a gunman entered the club and opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle.\n",
            "Anderson, who was bartending at the club that night, attributed the violence, in part, to “hate speech” coming from people in power, and he had a message for them. \n",
            "“To the politicians and activists who accuse LGBTQ people of grooming children and being abusers: Shame on you,” he said. “As leaders of our country, it is your obligation to represent all of us, not just the ones you happen to agree with. Hate speech turns into hate action, and actions based on hate almost took my life from me at 25 years old. I beg you all to consider your words before you speak them, for someone may use those words to justify action — action that may take someone’s life.”\n",
            "James Slaugh, who was shot in the arm during the attack, said rhetoric that threatens to restrict what sports transgender people can play, what bathrooms they can use and the legitimacy of LGBTQ people’s marriages and families is connected to the shooting. \n",
            "“The hateful rhetoric we’ve heard from elected leaders is the direct cause of the horrific shooting at Club Q,” he said. “We need elected leaders to demonstrate language that reflects love and understanding — not hate and fear.”\n",
            "Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization, said in a video message to the committee that the group has been tracking and reporting on “dangerous conditions for LGBTQ Americans.”\n",
            "So far this year, states have considered more than 300 anti-LGBTQ bills, 20 children’s hospitals that provide gender-affirming medical care to minors have received bomb threats, and there have been nearly 150 attacks on LGBTQ events, Ellis said.  \n",
            "A GLAAD poll released last month found that 48% of LGBTQ people fear for their safety in the current political environment. That number was higher, at 72%, for transgender respondents. \n",
            "“Why is this happening? It starts with candidates and politicians who deliberately spread disinformation and anti-LGBTQ inflammatory political messaging,” Ellis said, adding that slurs targeting queer people have surged online in recent months. \n",
            "In the month after the Florida Senate passed the Parental Rights in Education bill, or what critics have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, on March 8, tweets mentioning the LGBTQ community alongside slurs such as “groomer,” “pedophile” and “predator” increased 406%, according to a report conducted by the LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign and the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate. \n",
            "“This behavior is all exacerbated when bad actors have easy access to assault weapons,” she said. “There is a direct line from dangerous words to violent behavior for the LGBTQ community.”\n",
            "Anderson and Slaugh, as well as Club Q founding owner Matthew Haynes, also called on Congress to take action to restrict access to assault weapons. Anderson specifically asked the committee to reinstate an assault weapons ban that lapsed in 2004. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, among others, found that mass shooting deaths were reduced while the ban was in effect, and another found that a similar ban could have helped prevent some in the years since.\n",
            "Haynes said he knows that the Colorado Springs community has been in the “thoughts and prayers” of many people, but that thoughts and prayers “are not changing the rhetoric of hate.”\n",
            "He said that, though Club Q has received a lot of support, he has also received hundreds of hateful comments. He read two of them to the committee, and both included homophobic slurs. In one, the author said the shooter was “doing God’s work.”\n",
            "He added that he attended the signing of the Respect for Marriage Act on Tuesday. The bill provides some federal protection for same-sex married couples, and Haynes said the event was the “first joy and pride” he has felt since the shooting. However, he said the 169 members of Congress who voted against the legislation sent him a message that “it is OK to disrespect and not support our marriages.”\n",
            "“We are being slaughtered and dehumanized across this country in communities you took oaths to protect,” he said. “LGBTQ issues are not political issues. They are not lifestyles. They are not beliefs. They are not choices. They are basic human rights.”\n",
            "The suspect accused of the Club Q shooting has since been charged with 305 criminal counts, including first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault and bias-motivated crimes.\n",
            "Though Anderson, the only bartender to survive the Club Q attack, said he will not forget the sound of rapid gunshots that he heard on Nov. 19, he still had a message of hope for LGBTQ people.\n",
            "“To my fellow LGBTQ community, events like this are designed to discourage us from speaking and living our truth,” he said. “They are designed to scare us from living openly, courageously and proudly. We must not succumb to fear. We must live prouder and louder than ever before.”\n",

            "\n",
            "Stephen \"tWitch\" Boss was a thoroughly modern dancer. He grooved with his family in TikTok videos. He appeared in the \"Step Up\" movies and the \"Magic Mike\" sequel. He lit up the stage of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" for nearly a decade.\n",
            "But when it came to the root of his own creative inspiration, Boss looked back to the early 20th century and the loose-limbed luminaries of Hollywood's golden age.\n",
            "\"The greatest of all time had to be Gene Kelly, man. Gene Kelly, because he’s a guy’s guy. I love Fred Astaire, but Fred Astaire was so smooth, and it was great. He was so classy,\" Boss told The Associated Press in 2014, the year he joined the \"Ellen\" show.\n",
            "\"But Gene Kelly — he could be like somebody’s dad, who just decided to get up off the couch and dance around and clean the kitchen up,\" Boss added.\n",
            "In the course of his all-too-brief artistic career, Boss — who died this week, at 40 — embodied so much of what he admired about Kelly: the easy charm, the infectious enthusiasm, the palpable zeal for his craft. You could imagine him dancing around his own kitchen.\n",
            "He could make others feel like jumping off the couch, too. In his eight years at the \"Ellen\" show, Boss richly endeared himself to viewers. He was a staple of the daytime series, helping to set a tempo that got audience members on their feet.\n",
            "The tributes that streamed in Wednesday were a testament to his effect on others and the sheer depth of his talent.\n",
            "Paula Abdul, a dancing star of the 1980s and a former judge on \"So You Think You Can Dance,\" praised him as a key member of the contemporary dance world.\n",
            "\"tWitch greeted the world every day with a beautiful smile that was a direct reflection of his beautiful heart,\" Abdul said in a statement. \"He was a beacon of light & a true talent whose legacy & impact will live on in the dance community.\"\n",
            "Stephen Laurel Boss was born on Sept. 29, 1982, in Montgomery, Alabama. He started dancing as a teenager, performing in several local and regional theater productions. He specialized in freestyle moves.\n",
            "Boss studied dance performance at Southern Union State Community College and Chapman University, and he later taught hip-hop dance at school back home in Alabama.\n",
            "\"He has the personality and the look to succeed,\" Leslie Crook, one of his former students, told The Montgomery Advertiser in 2008. \"He is just one of those 'so likable' people.\n",
            "\"Everyone that meets him falls in love with him,\" she said.\n",
            "Boss eventually moved to Los Angeles to chase his dreams of professional dance stardom. He scored small but career-boosting roles in the movies \"Blades of Glory\" and \"Hairspray,\" an adaptation of the Broadway smash.\n",
            "\"So You Think You Can Dance,\" a reality show on Fox, introduced Boss to a much wider audience. He was the first runner-up during the show's 2008 season, and he served as a judge a decade later.\n",
            "\"It really ingrained in me that you can do anything if you put your mind to it,\" Boss told The Montgomery Advertiser in February 2009.\n",
            "Boss made national headlines during the 2008 season, when he and a dance partner, Kherington Payne, performed a Viennese Waltz set to the Celine Dion song \"A New Day Has Come.\"\n",
            "The dance had been created by choreographer Jean Marc Genereux as a tribute to his young daughter who had Rett syndrome, a severe genetic disorder.\n",
            "The performance reportedly moved the judges and audience members to tears.\n",
            "\"The only time she gets so animated is when she sees people move,\" Genereux told The New York Times, referring to his daughter. \"Hopefully this piece will make her react and feel great.\"\n",
            "\"So You Think You Can Dance\" sent Boss to the next level of his career. He landed a part in the 2010 movie \"Stomp the Yard: Homecoming\" and got cast in three entries in the \"Step Up\" film series: \"Step Up 3D,\" \"Step Up Revolution\" and \"Step Up: All In.\"\n",
            "Boss also appeared in a small role in \"Magic Mike XXL,\" the 2015 sequel to Steven Soderbergh's portrait of a male stripper, played by Channing Tatum.\n",
            "Boss began his tenure on the \"Ellen\" show in 2014, where he started out as a recurring guest DJ before taking on a more permanent role. He was a beloved fixture of the show, and in 2020 he was promoted to an executive producer role.\n",
            "When the \"Ellen\" show was coming to an end last year, the host paid tribute to her sidekick and collaborator in glowing terms.\n",

            "Boss, seemingly caught off guard, embraced DeGeneres and sat down next to her for an extended homage. The audience cheered and applauded.\n",
            "Boss continued to reach into the homes of his fans even after the \"Ellen\" show ended. He and his wife, fellow professional dancer Allison Holker Boss, frequently posted videos on TikTok: the couple dancing to Lizzo; their kids dancing to a Fisher Price DJ toy.\n",

            "\n",
            "WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, beaming with confidence after having proved his doubters wrong and expanded his majority in the midterm elections, vowed without hesitation that the Democratic Party will keep control again in two years.\n",
            "“Yes, I absolutely do [believe it will] if we stick to our North Star, which is: help people with things that they need help with,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said in an interview Wednesday in the Capitol.\n",
            "It will be a herculean task. Democrats are defending three seats in the Republican-leaning states of West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. They’re looking to hold five more seats in the closely divided states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona, where Sen. Kyrsten Sinema recently quit the party and became an independent. And their best pickup opportunities are in Republican-trending Florida and the GOP stronghold of Texas.\n",
            "To get there, Schumer promised that Democrats will govern and campaign over the next two years as pragmatists, not ideologues. “We believe government should help everyday families, but on things they care about, not in some ideological way,\" he said.\n",
            "Schumer attributed his confidence to two factors.\n",
            "First, he said, the Democratic-led Congress’ recent achievements will deliver results over the next two years that voters will reward. He cited the Inflation Reduction Act's provisions to lower prescription medicine prices and cap Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 a year. And he said infrastructure spending will ramp up and semiconductors plants will be built because of the CHIPS and Science Act.\n",
            "“There’s a lot of benefits that are already in the pipeline,” he said.\n",
            "Second, he argued, Democrats won this year by driving a contrast with Republicans, running as a party that’s “getting things done,” as opposed to a GOP that he claimed has been captured by extremist forces aligned with former President Donald Trump. Schumer pointed to the newly conservative Supreme Court, which rolled back abortion rights and expanded the right to carry guns this year.\n",
            "As a result, Schumer warned that suburban voters who have ditched the GOP in recent years will see no reason to return, calling it “part of a realignment” in the American electorate.\n",
            "“The MAGA influence on the party will not go away very quickly. They’re very strong. They’re very active. They’re hard-right,” he said, arguing that “that MAGA group that’s way out there” will hurt Republicans even if Trump isn’t their 2024 presidential nominee.\n",
            "“You put those two things together, and I think the election results in 2024 might be better than a lot of people are now predicting,” he said.\n",
            "Republicans are pointing fingers over a disastrous 2022 election result, in which they squandered a host of opportunities to pick up seats as midterm elections almost always benefit the party out of the White House. Instead, Democrats expanded their Senate majority from 50 to 51 seats.\n",
            "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blamed the party’s poor showing on “candidate quality” problems in key races, arguing that Trump’s endorsements propelled flawed candidates in GOP primaries in states like Arizona and Georgia, who went on to lose to Democrats in the general election.\n",
            "“I do think we have an opportunity to relearn, one more time: We have to have quality candidates to win in competitive Senate races,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday.\n",
            "Asked Wednesday whether the party will be more active in picking candidates in primaries, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the incoming chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said simply: “We want to win general elections.”\n",

            "The mother of one of four Idaho college students killed last month said Tuesday that authorities didn’t notify her before they asked the public for information about a white sedan, a car police have described as a potentially critical clue.\n",
            "In an interview with NBC’s \"TODAY\" show, Kristi Goncalves, the mother of Kaylee Goncalves, said she learned of the Dec. 7 plea for information about the occupants of a Hyundai sedan from her daughter, who had read about it in news articles.\n",
            "“My first thought just started being like, how long have they had this information? Where do they get this information? Was it on a camera?” she recalled, adding that an initial burst of happiness gave way to confusion when she realized that she’d learned of the clue along with everyone else.\n",

            "In a news release, Moscow police said the car, believed to be a 2011-2013 Elantra, was seen in the area of the three-story, six-bedroom home where the students were found dead on Nov. 13. \n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "After a two-week standoff between protesters and construction crews building a border wall made of shipping containers, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Arizona, accusing it of trespassing on federal land.\n",
            "The lawsuit asks for \"immediate injuctive relief prohibiting\" the state from continuing work on the wall, which federal officials say is being built on federal land without the required permits or authority.\n",
            "\"Arizona has unlawfully and without authority failed to remove the shipping containers from lands owned by the United States or over which the United States holds easements, thereby damaging the United States,\" the complaint reads.\n",
            "The lawsuit follows months of tension between outgoing Gov. Doug Ducey's office and federal agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the Interior, both of which oversee public land on which the barrier is being built.\n",
            "In August, Ducey issued an executive order directing the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to fill gaps in the existing border wall in Yuma County using shipping containers.\n",
            "The federal government has said the land is public and called the project “unlawful.\"\n",
            "In October, Ducey sued federal officials who head agencies overseeing public land, including the Forest Service and the Agriculture Department. The federal government asked that the lawsuit be dismissed.\n",
            "The project has since expanded to Cochise County, where local residents and environmentalists have withstood snow and freezing temperatures to hold protests.\n",
            "On Tuesday, Ducey's office told the Justice Department in a letter that Arizona “stands ready to cooperate with the federal government on construction of a border wall and always has been.” The letter indicated work has been paused.\n",
            "Ducey’s spokesman, C.J. Karamargin, said, \"From our perspective, the containers were always intended to be a temporary solution to an ongoing problem, and that's the problem of an unsecure border.\"\n",
            "“This should be the beginning of the end of Doug Ducey’s lawless assault on protected national forestlands and endangered wildlife,” Russ McSpadden, Southwest conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in an emailed statement. “Ducey is spending his last days in office wasting millions of taxpayer dollars dumping toxic railcars on some of the most beautiful, biodiverse lands in Arizona. We’re hopeful a judge will quickly stop this heartless, reckless PR stunt in its tracks.”\n",
            "Also Wednesday, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a notice of intent to sue Ducey's office over the wall because of ecological concerns.\n",
            "The center says the wall violated the Clean Water Act in the Coronado National Forest, near where its construction is taking place.\n",
            "Dr. Robin Silver with the Center for Biological Diversity said the intent to sue is necessary because the federal complaint against Ducey's office does not go far enough in asking for the construction to immediately stop. Important waterways are being damaged or altered by the placement of shipping containers on land that serves as important habitats and crossings, including for endangered species, he said.\n",
            "\"We don’t trust the feds,\" he said. \"Under the Clean Water Act, they have created a dam with those shipping containers, and it just looks like a junkyard now.\"\n",
            "Demonstrators have said they will not leave their protest site until the containers are removed, even if it means camping in tents in below-freezing temperatures through the upcoming holidays.\n",

            "We have 'ignition': Fusion breakthrough draws energy gain\n",
            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "U.S. scientists have achieved “ignition” —  a fusion reaction that produced more energy than it took to create — a critical milestone for nuclear fusion and a step forward in the pursuit of a nearly limitless source of clean energy, Energy Department officials said Tuesday. \n",
            "Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and other stars, occurs when two atoms’ nuclei collide under extreme temperatures, causing a reaction that can generate incredible amounts of energy with few environmental costs. \n",
            "Scientists have been chasing the promise of fusion since the dawn of the atomic age, but had yet to cross a threshold in which more energy was created by a fusion reaction than the energy needed to produce it. \n",
            "To exceed that milestone, researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility last week fired the energy of 192 laser beams at a cylindrical target called a hohlraum, creating x-ray radiation. The radiation imploded a tiny, diamond capsule filled with two isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, releasing energy.  \n",
            "\"We have taken the first tentative steps toward a clean energy source,\" said Jill Hruby, the Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration.\n",
            "The breakthrough will not immediately open the floodgates to clean power in American homes, but it is a powerful symbol that the fundamental scientific concepts underlying the promise of fusion are sound. \n",
            "“There are a lot of scientists who said, ‘I don’t believe any of you guys. You’ll never make it work,’” said Stephen Bodner, a former director of the laser fusion program at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, or NRL. “Livermore showed — lo and behold — you can do it.” \n",
            "U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm described the breakthrough as \"one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century.”\n",
            "Engineering challenges remain that could take years or decades to work out before the technology could fuel power plants and transfer energy to the U.S. electrical grid, experts say. \n",
            "While the Livermore team achieved what researchers call a scientific break-even or energy gain, it did not achieve an engineering break-even: The inefficient lasers used in the experiment required about 300 megajoules of energy to fire just 2 megajoules of energy into the experiment. The reaction produced about 3 megajoules of energy.\n",
            "The reaction started and finished in about as long as it takes to blink your eyes and temperatures were roughly ten times hotter than the temperature of the sun, Livermore scientists said in a news conference.   \n",
            "Scientists must now find ways to reduce inefficiencies, burn a larger portion of available fuel during the reaction and harness the energy for use as electricity, said Troy Carter, a professor in UCLA’s department of physics and astronomy and the director of the Plasma Science and Technology Institute.\n",
            "“The laser technology at NIF is ‘90s technology,” he said. NIF’s lasers can perform only a few shots each day. A power plant would require about 10 shots per second. Researchers would also have to figure out how to mass produce perfect capsules. \n",
            "\"Now that we have a capsule that ignites, we need to figure out: can we make it simpler? Can we begin to make this process easier and more repeatable? Can we begin to do it more than one time of day?\" said Kim Budil, the director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. \"Each of these is an incredible scientific and engineering challenge for us.\"\n",
            "The National Ignition Facility program is not designed to make energy for electricity; instead, it’s part of the “stockpile stewardship” program for U.S. nuclear weapons, which allows scientists to verify their reliability without detonation.\n",
            "It’s unlikely the next big advances will come out of the NIF laboratory, experts say. \n",
            "“The NIF facility is doing world-leading research, but it was never designed to generate electricity; it's not a power plant,” said R. David Edelman, the chief policy and global affairs officer for TAE Technologies, a California-based fusion company.\n",
            "Instead, advances could come from other federal laboratories or from the private sector, where investors are seeding billions into a smattering of fusion projects. \n",
            "Some projects use similar technology to what NIF has demonstrated; others are pursuing a technology that uses magnets to confine plasma at extreme temperatures to force fusion reactions. \n",
            "Fusion companies reported more than $4.7 billion in total private investment commitments through the end of the year, according to the Fusion Industry Association. Fusion projects could see a boost in federal funding in the U.S., too. The Inflation Reduction Act provided millions in new funding for fusion projects and the White House this year convened the first fusion summit and developed a 10-year plan to commercialize fusion technology. \n",
            "Bodner said he’s always been cautious with predictions about nuclear fusion in the past, but became convinced in the last few years that a fusion program could succeed if the federal government shifted its focus from weaponry to energy production. \n",
            "“I think well within a decade, a well-run program would either succeed or fail. The technology is ready to go. What’s mainly needed is the money,” he said, adding the next step would be to build a more efficient, high-powered laser.\n",
            "With fusion, there is no risk of a nuclear meltdown and it produces only helium as waste. Fusion reactors use relatively little fuel and cannot be used for nuclear warfare.\n",
            "The core materials — deuterium and tritium — are theoretically plentiful. Deuterium is abundant and can be extracted from water, Carter said. Tritium can be extracted from lithium, which is also in ocean water. \n",
            "“Hundreds of thousands to millions of years of fuel for all energy we need on earth is in seawater,” Carter said. \n",
            "If scientists can work out more of the problems that have dogged fusion for seven decades, it would be a reliable source of power to work in concert with wind and solar power to boost the clean energy movement. \n",
            "“You can deploy it anywhere and it can be always available,” Carter said. “If we deploy it in time, I think it could fill a lot of the energy needs of the future.”\n",
            "Researchers view it as a complement for wind and solar power, which are scaling up quickly and falling in cost but remain dependent on particular weather conditions and are difficult to store with today’s technology. \n",
            "From a cost perspective, “I don’t think you’ll ever compete with wind and solar. They just sit there and turn out energy, there’s nothing simpler than that,” Bodner said. \n",
            "Paul Dabbar, the former undersecretary of energy for science until 2021, compared the process of scaling the experimental reaction at a lab into a commercially viable source of electricity to the evolution of electric vehicles over the past several decades.  \n",
            "“It takes a while, but it’s doable,” said Dabbar, now a visiting fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “What we did 15 years ago has now turned into whole new industries. So the prospect of this not in two years, but in 10 to 15 years, similar to what happened with EVs and lithium-ion is absolutely possible.” \n",
            "Dabbar predicted that developing the experimental process into commercial power plants would require additional “hard science” from the federally supported National Laboratories as well as major universities that conduct fusion research, plus start-ups and private-sector companies with experience in building power plants.\n",
            "As humans seek ways to power modern life without harming the planet, Dabbar said it was fitting that the “ultimate source” of clean energy would be the one we see every day in the sky: The sun, whose process of nuclear fusion scientists have spent decades trying to recreate.\n",
            "“Nature decided that fusing hydrogen atoms was the most efficient way to make energy. The universe is populated primarily with hydrogen,” Dabbar said. “So nature’s already made its decision on what’s best.”\n",

            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "Asian American voters in Georgia showed strong Democratic leanings in the recent Senate runoff election, according to an exit poll. \n",
            "An Election Day poll released by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund on Wednesday showed that 78% of Asian American voters supported Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who won, while about 22% favored Republican opponent Herschel Walker. \n",
            "While the results reflect that the votes of Asian Americans, who are 4.7% of the state’s overall electorate, grew in support for Warnock since the midterm elections last month, Phi Nguyen, the executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said that whether or not the party can sustain the momentum and loyalty requires long-term engagement. \n",
            "“There is a left tilt. At the same time … there’s a lot of opportunity left for parties to do that intentional outreach,” Nguyen said. “I think there is a risk of losing folks if they take voters for granted.”\n",
            "For the exit poll, the organization surveyed 337 Asian American voters across DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties at five key high-Asian American precincts. The polling was conducted in four Asian languages — Bengali, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese — as well as English.\n",
            "It showed that support for Warnock in the runoff exceeded that in the general election last month, when 60% said they favored Warnock. The percentage who favored Walker, however, dipped from the 33% support in the midterms.\n",
            "The survey, which also broke down voters by ethnicity, showed that Bangladeshi Americans had the highest support for Warnock, at over 96%, with Walker getting about 4%. Chinese Americans, who showed the lowest support for the senator, still overwhelmingly favored him, at 61.5%.\n",
            "Nguyen emphasized that political opinions across the electorate are far from monolithic, pointing to the poll’s breakdown of Asian American voters by age. Those ages 18 to 29 voted for Warnock at 92% and Walker at about 7%.\n",
            "The results were largely different among voters 70 and over, who favored Walker at 62.5%. A minority of that demographic supported Warnock at 37.5%. \n",
            "“Younger AAPI are getting more and more progressive,” Nguyen said, using the initialism for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. “There’s just a widening gap there.”\n",
            "Asian American voters prioritized a number of issues, ranking education, health care and economy/jobs as the top three categories influencing their votes. But when the results are broken down by candidate choice, those who supported Warnock ranked health care and education as their top two priorities, with the economy as the third. Those who voted for Walker ranked economy/jobs and education as top categories influencing their votes. Taxes ranked third place.\n",
            "Karthick Ramakrishnan, the founder of the research and civic engagement organization AAPI Data, said that while there are important insights to be drawn from the poll, particularly because the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund is also involved in poll monitoring, there are a few limitations. Polling occurred in areas with higher densities of Asian American voters, which tend to skew Democratic. He also said there are likely to be differences between the demographic who voted on Election Day and those who voted early, depending on age, language access needs and party registration.\n",
            "“At the same time, we should be careful to draw conclusions about the composition of the Asian American electorate or their voter preferences from surveys that are designed to ensure ballot access,” he said.\n",
            "Ramakrishnan said that the uptick in support for Warnock since the midterms was significant and that communities will be better served, through more survey and interview data, if groups work to understand why — whether it’s because of the way the survey was conducted or because of changes in turnout and voter preferences.\n",
            "Nguyen similarly noted that in the Atlanta area, voters heavily favored Warnock. And with much of the polling done in that region, results could have skewed further toward him compared to the rest of the state. In her interactions with voters on the ground, there were still many whom her organization considered “high potential” voters, or those who did not participate in the last few election cycles, and were still highly undecided.\n",
            "“A lot of those voters that we were talking to are voters that are not prioritized by candidates or by parties and who have more of a risk of being left behind and not invested in,” Nguyen said. “I think that if you show up and you talk to those voters and you have things in-language, it shows a lot of investment and care that could go a long way.”\n",

            "Elon Musk doesn’t care about pronouns — unless nonbinary people use them\n",
            "https://static.adsafeprotected.com/skeleton.gif\n",
            "\n",
            "What is it with Elon Musk and pronouns? His viral tweet on Sunday — “My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci” — was not the first time the richest man in the world has expressed his annoyance and disdain with one of the most inescapable parts of language. In July 2020, he tweeted “Pronouns suck,” and in December of that year he tweeted a meme implying that people who include their pronouns in their social media bios are trying to oppress others, for which he refused to apologize despite facing backlash. He defended himself by tweeting, “I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare.”\n",
            "While Sunday’s tweet was clearly directed at outgoing White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci over what can only be referred to as a QAnon-like conspiracy theory over the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the format of the tweet, as well as some of Musk’s follow-up comments, were clearly a dig at trans and nonbinary people. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., also helped solidify the inherent transphobia in this remark by responding, “I affirm your pronouns Elon.” Affirming someone’s gender identity is an act of acknowledgment, validation and respect that is commonly demonstrated through simple tasks like using the correct name and pronouns and not referring to someone’s updated pronouns as “preferred.” Greene’s tweet mocked this basic courtesy.\n",
            "Musk and others who have jumped on the pronoun backlash train require people to use pronouns as much as the next person, they just pretend they don’t because their pronouns stay the same throughout their lives.\n",
            "But Musk and others who have jumped on the pronoun backlash train require people to use pronouns as much as the next person, they just pretend they don’t because their pronouns stay the same throughout their lives. Grammatically speaking, pronouns are noun substitutes, or words used to describe ourselves and others without the use of names or proper nouns. Without them, our sentence structures would be quite clunky and redundant. That’s why we use pronouns like you, we, us, me, him, her and they: to help break up the usage of first and last names and make our syntax flow better. \n",
            "However, when it comes to bad-faith jokes and so-called “debates” over pronouns, no one is actually arguing that we should do away with them and only refer to each other using proper nouns. For the people who insist on making pronouns problematic, the real issue lies not in the concept of pronouns itself but in who is using them and whether they vary with one’s assigned sex at birth, which can differ from a person’s gender identity.\n",
            "That much was made quite clear in Musk’s response to some of the criticism he faced following Sunday’s tweet. After being called out by former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who asked him not to “mock and promote hate toward” vulnerable members of the LGBTQ community, who “have real feelings” and are often the targets of violence, Musk replied, “I strongly disagree. Forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask, and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t, is neither good nor kind to anyone.” \n",
            "What Musk and his ilk seem to disregard or fail to understand, however, is that correct pronoun usage is all about basic respect and human decency. While many cis people will never have to think twice about which pronouns they use to describe themselves, trans and nonbinary people do not have that same luxury and will likely need to communicate those pronouns to others to avoid being misgendered. It’s not about “forcing” anyone to do anything. It’s about treating trans people with respect. No one would ever think to question Musk’s gender identity or ridicule him for using he/him pronouns because that would be inaccurate and disrespectful. It’s also not difficult to apologize and self-correct if you unintentionally use the wrong pronouns. \n",
            "The implication that respecting someone’s pronouns is somehow an imposition that could potentially result in ostracizing is also wildly off base. If you make a mistake, you make a mistake. It’s unlikely someone is going to hold it against you forever. If you go out of your way to intentionally misgender someone, however, that is transphobic. If you can’t respect someone enough to call them by the correct name of pronouns, not because you’re forgetful, but because you don’t want to, you’re transphobic. If that is the case, people have a right not to want to be associated with you if you don’t respect them or their loved ones enough to treat them with the same dignity and decency you would anyone else. Failing to do so is not only offensive and insulting, but it’s also incredibly dehumanizing. And if you can’t even accept something as basic as someone’s pronouns and identity, you’re making it pretty clear that you do not support their civil rights and liberties. \n",
            "The implication that respecting someone’s pronouns is somehow an imposition that could potentially result in ostracizing is also wildly off base.\n",
            "The general phenomenon of transphobes complaining about and making fun of trans people’s pronoun usage is certainly not new, but it has become more mainstream and is now a common topic among many conservatives politicians and commentators (and some Democrats like Bill Maher) in both print and cable news, and the excuses they come up with to justify their intolerance are always the same. They either feign concern over proper grammar or try to make the claim that respecting trans people’s pronouns is somehow akin to compelled speech, neither of which is correct. While this anger typically extends to all trans people, regardless of which pronouns they use, ire is often specifically directed at those who use they/them pronouns, which many claim is grammatically incorrect. \n",
            "Although many people are only familiar with the usage of “they” as a plural pronoun, it has long been used as a singular pronoun to refer to someone whose gender is unknown. In fact, the singular usage of the word “they” dates all the way back to the 14th century. The word “you” has also had a similar evolution in English grammar, starting as a plural pronoun that also became singular later on.\n",
            "At the end of the day, it costs nothing to respect someone’s pronouns. If people can’t show someone such a basic form of kindness and courtesy, then that’s on them, but let’s not pretend that hatred of pronouns is about grammar or free speech. It’s about bigotry. And it’s hard to see how Musk would somehow be unaware of that. While his initial tweet was a malicious replication of a tired and unfunny “joke” about pronouns and gender identity, it was ultimately his response to Kelly’s criticism of this tweet that really hammered home his bad-faith intentions. It demonstrated his complete disregard for trans and nonbinary people’s rights, existence and humanity. \n",

            "LONDON — The epic squabble between Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, and the rest of the British royal family burst back into the open Thursday, in a Netflix series that promised to reveal the “truth” about the rift pitting Hollywood glamor against the centuries-old institution.\n",
            "Harry and Meghan are clearly keen to tell the story of their relationship from their perspective. But while the the first three of the six episodes do feature some unseen footage of the couple and messages between them, they offer little new information about them and the controversies that have swirled around them.\n",
            "“This is a great love story,” Harry says in the first 10 minutes. “And the crazy thing is, I think this love story is only getting started.”\n",
            "Referring to his mother, Princess Diana, who was 36 when she died in a car crash while being chased by photographers in Paris, Harry describes himself as “my mother’s son” when talking about his relationship with Meghan.\n",
            "“I think for so many people in the family, especially obviously the men, there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold, as opposed to someone you are perhaps destined to be with. The difference between making decisions between your head or your heart,” he says.\n",
            "“My mom certainly made most of her decisions, if not all of them, from her heart and I am my mother’s son,” he adds. \n",
            "The series is being carefully watched in Britain, with coverage of the documentary dominating publications that Harry has accused of hounding his family.\n",
            "“Sussexes’ war on royals” intones the Daily Mail. “Netfibs: Five times Meg and Harry appeared to change their story in bombshell Netflix doc,” The Sun proclaims.\n",
            "Aside from showing the story of their courtship, the six episodes of “Harry & Meghan” also look set to highlight long-running grievances that have roiled Britain's royal family for years.\n",
            "Harry's obvious anger at the media surfaces multiple times. He says it is his “duty to uncover this exploitation and bribery that happens within our media,” and is “genuinely concerned” for the safety of his family. “No one know the full truth, we know the full truth, the institution knows the full truth and the media knows the full truth because they’ve been in on it.” \n",
            "“Every relationship that I had within a matter of weeks or months was splattered all over the newspapers and that person’s family harassed and their lives turned upside down,” he says later.\n",
            "After their relationship became public, Meghan says in the second episode, members of the media “paid certain neighbors” near her home in Toronto “to put a livestream camera into my backyard.”\n",
            "“My face was everywhere, my life was everywhere, tabloids had taken over everything,” she adds.\n",
            "The episode also touches on Meghan’s early life and features her mom, Doria Ragland, who describes the last five years as “challenging.”   \n",
            "Meghan, who has described herself as mixed race, also talks about the media’s coverage of her race. “It’s very different to be a minority but not be treated as a minority right off the bat. Obviously now people are very aware of my race because they made it such an issue when I went to the U.K. But before that, most people didn’t treat me like a Black woman,” she says.    \n",
            "The third episode serves as a sort of lesson on racism and oppression stemming from Britain's vast empire, and the historical relationship between slavery and the royal family. \n",
            "The British tabloids have intensely scrutinized Meghan, publishing stories about her estranged family following her engagement and marriage to Harry in May 2018. The couple has won several lawsuits against their publishers in recent years, while some remain unresolved.\n",
            "Harry says that the media coverage early in their relationship was viewed by a lot of his family “almost like a rite of passage.”\n",
            "“Some of the members of the family were like, ‘Right, my wife has been put through that, so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be different?’ And I said, ‘The difference here is the race element.’”\n",
            "Later he adds, \"The fact that I was dating an American actress was probably what clouded their judgment more than anything else at the beginning. Oh, he’s dating an actress, this won’t last.\"  \n",
            "It is awkward timing for the release of the show, coming three months after Queen Elizabeth II’s death and the ascension of Harry’s father, Charles, as king. It also comes less than a week after his brother, Prince William, and his wife, Catherine, Princess of Wales, made a high-profile trip to the United States. \n",
            "Before and after leaving Britain for North America, the couple accused the royal household of not defending Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, from the intrusive and sometimes racist coverage by the country’s voracious tabloid press. In addition, Harry is challenging in court a decision by the British government to deny him police protection while in Britain. \n",
            "Directed by Liz Garbus — the Emmy-winning producer of the Netflix documentary “What Happened, Miss Simone?” — the three episodes are being released Thursday and three more Dec. 15. The Sussexes' media company, Archewell Productions, is listed as one of the three producers.\n",
            "Interest in the couple intensified after they stepped down as senior royals in January 2020 to eventually build new lives in California. Harry was later stripped of his honorary military titles and the British Home Office — the ministry responsible for policing, immigration and security — decided that he would no longer receive personal police security while in Britain even if he were to cover the cost himself.\n",
            "In a wide-ranging interview with the media mogul Oprah Winfrey last March, the couple described a lack of support for the newlyweds and Meghan's experience with suicidal thoughts. The pair also alleged that in the months leading up to the birth of their son, Archie, a royal insider expressed “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born.”\n",
            "“That conversation, I’m never going to share. But at the time, it was awkward. I was a bit shocked,” Harry told the talk show host. Winfrey later said the conversation was not with the queen or her husband, Prince Philip. \n",
            "Even before going live, the series elicited a strong response in Britain, where the “feeling amongst the British public is 'enough is enough,'” the author and journalist Katie Nicholl told NBC News on Wednesday. \n",
            "“We have heard this before. What more can they say?” she added.\n",
            "Nicholl said that Charles was attempting to put “down his blueprint,” but “there seems to be so many distractions, particularly from across the Atlantic and coming out of the Sussex camp.” \n",
            "“It seems to be a case of anything you can do, we’re going to do and get more headlines,” she added.\n",
            "However, Nicholl said, Buckingham Palace would take allegations about leaking and planting stories “very, very seriously,” because it was “potentially quite damaging.” \n",
            "“This is a centuries-old institution that wants to prove that it’s fit for modern purpose,” she said, adding that the couple’s racism accusations were “damaging” to both the palace and to “Britain as a country.”  \n",
            "Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on the series.\n",
            "The trailers for the series have already courted controversy as several seasoned royal commentators have suggested that archival footage and pictures featured in them were taken at events that had nothing to do with the couple. \n",

            "The British tabloids have intensely scrutinized Meghan, publishing stories about her estranged family following her engagement and marriage to Harry in May 2018. The couple has won several lawsuits against their publishers in recent years, while some remain unresolved.\n",
            "Harry says that the media coverage early in their relationship was viewed by a lot of his family “almost like a rite of passage.”\n",
            "“Some of the members of the family were like, ‘Right, my wife has been put through that, so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be different?’ And I said, ‘The difference here is the race element.’”\n",
            "Later he adds, \\\"The fact that I was dating an American actress was probably what clouded their judgment more than anything else at the beginning. Oh, he’s dating an actress, this won’t last.\\\"  \n",
            "It is awkward timing for the release of the show, coming three months after Queen Elizabeth II’s death and the ascension of Harry’s father, Charles, as king. It also comes less than a week after his brother, Prince William, and his wife, Catherine, Princess of Wales, made a high-profile trip to the United States. \n",
            "Before and after leaving Britain for North America, the couple accused the royal household of not defending Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, from the intrusive and sometimes racist coverage by the country’s voracious tabloid press. In addition, Harry is challenging in court a decision by the British government to deny him police protection while in Britain. \n",
            "Directed by Liz Garbus — the Emmy-winning producer of the Netflix documentary “What Happened, Miss Simone?” — the three episodes are being released Thursday and three more Dec. 15. The Sussexes' media company, Archewell Productions, is listed as one of the three producers.\n",
            "Interest in the couple intensified after they stepped down as senior royals in January 2020 to eventually build new lives in California. Harry was later stripped of his honorary military titles and the British Home Office — the ministry responsible for policing, immigration and security — decided that he would no longer receive personal police security while in Britain even if he were to cover the cost himself.\n",
            "In a wide-ranging interview with the media mogul Oprah Winfrey last March, the couple described a lack of support for the newlyweds and Meghan's experience with suicidal thoughts. The pair also alleged that in the months leading up to the birth of their son, Archie, a royal insider expressed “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born.”\n",
            "“That conversation, I’m never going to share. But at the time, it was awkward. I was a bit shocked,” Harry told the talk show host. Winfrey later said the conversation was not with the queen or her husband, Prince Philip. \n",
            "Even before going live, the series elicited a strong response in Britain, where the “feeling amongst the British public is 'enough is enough,'” the author and journalist Katie Nicholl told NBC News on Wednesday. \n",
            "“We have heard this before. What more can they say?” she added.\n",
            "Nicholl said that Charles was attempting to put “down his blueprint,” but “there seems to be so many distractions, particularly from across the Atlantic and coming out of the Sussex camp.” \n",
            "“It seems to be a case of anything you can do, we’re going to do and get more headlines,” she added.\n",
            "However, Nicholl said, Buckingham Palace would take allegations about leaking and planting stories “very, very seriously,” because it was “potentially quite damaging.” \n",
            "“This is a centuries-old institution that wants to prove that it’s fit for modern purpose,” she said, adding that the couple’s racism accusations were “damaging” to both the palace and to “Britain as a country.”  \n",
            "Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on the series.\n",
            "The trailers for the series have already courted controversy as several seasoned royal commentators have suggested that archival footage and pictures featured in them were taken at events that had nothing to do with the couple. \n",
            "One clip showing men running with cameras was used to illustrate the paparazzi hounding the couple, but was taken as the British model and reality TV star Katie Price arrived at a courthouse to be sentenced for DUI, analysis by several British media outlets including Sky News has shown. (Sky News is owned by Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)   \n",
            "Doug Seeburg also told The Sun newspaper that the image featuring him among a throng of other photographers was taken ahead of the premiere for “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two,” in July 2011, years before the couple met.  \n",
            "“In the Netflix trailer, it’s implied the photographers, including me, were trying to get a shot of the royal couple — but that’s nonsense,” he told the tabloid.\n",
            "Netflix did not respond to a request for comment on the record.  \n",
            "Henry Austin is a London-based editor for NBC News Digital.\n"
